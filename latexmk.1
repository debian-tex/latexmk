.SH NAME
latexmk \- generate LaTeX document
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B latexmk [options] [file ...] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Latexmk  
completely automates the process of compiling a LaTeX document.
Essentially, it is like a specialized relative of the general
\fImake\fR utility, but one which determines dependencies
automatically and has some other very useful features.  In its basic
mode of operation \fIlatexmk\fR is given the name of the primary
source file for a document, and it issues the appropriate sequence of
commands to generate a .dvi, .ps, .pdf and/or hardcopy version of the
document.
.PP
By default \fIlatexmk\fR will run the commands necessary to generate 
a .dvi file, which copies the behavior of earlier versions when only
\fIlatex\fR was available.
.PP
\fILatexmk\fR can also be set to run continuously with a suitable
previewer.  In that case the \fIlatex\fR program (or one of its
relatives), etc, are rerun whenever
one of the source files is modified, and the previewer automatically
updates the on-screen view of the compiled document.
.PP
\fILatexmk\fR determines which are the source files by examining the
log file.  (Optionally, it also examines the list of input and output
files generated by the \fB-recorder\fR option of modern versions of
\fIlatex\fR (and \fIpdflatex\fR, \fIxelatex\fR, \fIlualatex\fR).
See the documentation for the \fB-recorder\fR option of \fIlatexmk\fR
below.)  When \fIlatexmk\fR is run, it examines properties of the
source files, and if any have been changed since the last document
generation, \fIlatexmk\fR will run the various LaTeX processing
programs as necessary.  In particular, it will repeat the run of
\fIlatex\fR (or a related program)) often enough to resolve all cross
references; depending on the macro packages used.  With some macro
packages and document classes, four, or even more, runs may be
needed. If necessary, \fIlatexmk\fR will also run \fIbibtex\fR,
\fIbiber\fR, and/or \fImakeindex\fR.  In addition, \fIlatexmk\fR can
be configured to generate other necessary files.  For example, from an
updated figure file it can automatically generate a file in
encapsulated postscript or another suitable format for reading by
LaTeX.
.PP
\fILatexmk\fR has two different previewing options.  With the simple
\fB-pv\fR option, a dvi, postscript or pdf previewer is automatically
run after generating the dvi, postscript or pdf version of the
document.  The type of file to view is selected according to
configuration settings and command line options.
.PP
The second previewing option is the powerful \fB-pvc\fR option
(mnemonic: "preview continuously").  In this case, \fIlatexmk\fR runs
continuously, regularly monitoring all the source files to see if any
have changed.  Every time a change is detected, \fIlatexmk\fR runs all
the programs necessary to generate a new version of the document.  A
good previewer will then automatically update its
display.  Thus the user can simply edit a file and, when the changes
are written to disk, \fIlatexmk\fR completely automates the cycle of
updating the .dvi (and/or the .ps and .pdf) file, and refreshing
the previewer's display.  It's not quite WYSIWYG, but usefully close.
.PP
For other previewers, the user may have to manually make the previewer
update its display, which can be (e.g., with some versions of \fIxdvi\fR and
\fIgsview\fR) as simple as forcing a redraw of its display.
.PP
\fILatexmk\fR has the ability to print a banner in gray diagonally
across each page when making the postscript file.  It can also, if
needed, call an external program to do other postprocessing on
generated dvi and postscript files.  (See the options \fB-dF\fR and
\fB-pF\fR, and the documentation for the \fI$dvi_filter\fR and
\fI$ps_filter\fR configuration variables.)  These capabilities are
leftover from older versions of \fIlatexmk\fR, but \fBare currently
non-functional\fR.
More flexibility can
be obtained in current versions, since the command strings for running
\fI*latex\fR can now be configured to run multiple
commands. 
This also extends the possibility of postprocessing generated files.
.PP
\fILatexmk\fR is highly configurable, both from the command line and
in configuration files, so that it can accommodate a wide variety of
user needs and system configurations.  Default values are set
according to the operating system, so \fIlatexmk\fR often works
without special configuration on MS-Windows, cygwin, Linux, OS-X, and
other UNIX systems.  See the section "Configuration/Initialization
(rc) Files", and then the later sections "How to Set Variables in
Initialization Files", "Format of Command Specifications", "List of
Configuration Variables Usable in Initialization Files", "Custom
Dependencies", and "Advanced Configuration"
.PP
A very annoying complication handled very reliably by \fIlatexmk\fR,
is that LaTeX is a multiple pass system.  On each run, LaTeX reads in
information generated on a previous run, for things like cross
referencing and indexing.  In the simplest cases, a second run of
LaTeX suffices, and often the log file contains a message about the
need for another pass.  However, there is a wide variety of add-on
macro packages to LaTeX, with a variety of behaviors.  The result is
to break simple-minded determinations of how many runs are needed and
of which programs.  \fILatexmk\fR has a highly
general and efficient solution to these issues.  The solution involves
retaining between runs information on the source files, and a symptom
is that \fIlatexmk\fR generates an extra file (with extension
\fI.fdb_latexmk\fR, by default) that contains the source file
information.

.SH LATEXMK OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS ON COMMAND LINE
In general the command line to invoke \fIlatexmk\fR has the form

	latexmk [options] [file]

All options can be introduced by single or double "-" characters,
e.g., "latexmk -help" or "latexmk --help".

\fBNote 1\fR: In the documentation, '\fI*latex\fR' means any of the
supported engines, i.e., currently \fIlatex\fR, \fIlualatex\fR,
\fIpdflatex\fR, \fIxelatex\fR.  Mention of a specific one of these normally
refers that specific engines.  Earlier versions of this documentation
weren't so consistent.  Which of these is used to compile a document,
depends on the configuration and the command line arguments.

\fBNote 2\fR: \fBIn addition to the options in the list below,
\fIlatexmk\fR recognizes almost all the options recognized by the
\fI*latex\fR programs in their 
current TeXLive and MiKTeX implementations.  Some of the options for
these programs trigger special action or behavior by
\fIlatexmk\fR, in which case they have specific explanations in this
document; in this case they may or may not be passed to *latex as well.

Run \fIlatexmk\fR with the \fB-showextraoptions\fR to get a
list of the options that \fIlatexmk\fR accepts and that are simply
passed through to \fI*latex\fR.  See also the
explanation of the \fB-showextraoptions\fR option for more
information.


\fBDefinitions of options and arguments\fR

.TP
.B file
One or more files can be specified.  If no files are specified,
\fIlatexmk\fR will, by default, run on all files in the current working directory
with a ".tex" extension.  This behavior can be changed: see the
description concerning the \fI@default_files\fR variable in the
section "List of configuration variables usable in initialization
files". 

If a file is specified without an extension, then the ".tex" extension
is automatically added, just as LaTeX does.  Thus, if you specify:

	latexmk foo

then \fIlatexmk\fR will operate on the file "foo.tex".

There are certain restrictions on what characters can be in a
filename; certain characters are either prohibited or problematic for
the \fIlatex\fR etc programs.  These characters are: "$", "%", "\\",
"~", the double quote character, and the control characters null, tab,
form feed, carriage return, line feed, and delete.  In addition "&" is
prohibited when it is the first character of a filename.

\fILatexmk\fR gives a fatal error when it detects any of the above
characters in the TeX filename(s) specified on the command line.
\fIHowever\fR before testing for illegal characters, \fIlatexmk\fR
removes matching pairs of double quotes from a filename.  This matches
the behavior of \fIlatex\fR etc, and deals with problems that occasionally
result from filenames that have been incorrectly quoted on the command
line.  \fIIn addition\fR, under Microsoft Windows, the forward slash
character "\\" is a directory separator, so \fIlatexmk\fR replaces it
by a forward slash "/", which is also a legal directory separator in
Windows, and is accepted by \fIlatex\fR etc.

.TP
.B -auxdir=FOO \fRor\fB -aux-directory=FOO
Sets the directory for auxiliary output files of *latex (.aux, .log etc).
These are all the generated files, with the exception of final output files
(.dvi, .ps, .pdf, .synctex.gz, .synctex).  See the
\fB-outdir\fR/\fB-output-directory\fR option for directories for the main
output files, and the \fB-out2dir\fR option for the final output files.

If the directory specified for the \fB-aux\fR/\fB-aux-directory\fR option
is blank, then the default is used, which is to be the same as the output
directory. 

If you also use the \fB-cd\fR option, and the specified auxiliary output
directory is a relative path, then the path is interpreted relative to
the document directory.

See the section AUXILIARY AND OUTPUT DIRECTORIES for more details.

.TP
.B -bibtex 
When the source file uses bbl files for bibliography, run bibtex or
biber as needed to regenerate the bbl files.  

This property can also be configured by setting the \fI$bibtex_use\fR
variable to 2 in a configuration file.

.TP
.B -bibtex-
Never run bibtex or biber.  Also, always treat .bbl files as precious,
i.e., do not delete them in a cleanup operation. 

A common use for this option is when a document comes from an external
source, complete with its bbl file(s), and the user does not have the
corresponding bib files available.  In this situation use of the
\fB-bibtex-\fR option will prevent \fIlatexmk\fR from trying to run
\fIbibtex\fR or \fIbiber\fR, which would result in overwriting of the
bbl files.

This property can also be configured by setting the \fI$bibtex_use\fR
variable to 0 in a configuration file.

.TP
.B -bibtex-cond
When the source file uses a bbl file for the bibliography and \fIbibtex\fR
is used to generate the bibliography, run \fIbibtex\fR as needed to
regenerate the bbl files only if the relevant bib file(s) exist.  Thus when
the bib file(s) are not available, \fIbibtex\fR is not run, thereby avoiding
overwriting of the bbl file.  Also, always treat .bbl files as precious,
i.e., do not delete them in a cleanup operation.

This is the default setting.  It can also be configured by setting the
\fI$bibtex_use\fR variable to 1 in a configuration file.

The reason for using this setting is first to allow automatic switching
between the use and non-use of \fIbibtex\fR depending on the existence or
not of a bib file.  In addition, when submitting articles to a scientific
journal, it is common to submit only .tex and .bbl files (plus graphics
files), but not a .bib file.  Hence it is often useful to treat .bbl files
as true source files, that should be preserved under a clean up operation.

This property can also be configured by setting the \fI$bibtex_use\fR
variable to 1 in a configuration file.

\fBNote\fR that when \fBbiber\fR is used, and a bib file doesn't exist, this
option does not prevent \fIbiber\fR from being run, with the bbl file then
being incorrect. 
See the
documentation on \fI$bibtex_use\fR for more details.  However, a bbl file
is treated as precious in a clean up operation.

.TP
.B -bibtex-cond1
The same as \fB-bibtex-cond\fR except that .bbl files are only
treated as precious if one or more bibfiles fails to exist.

Thus if all the bib files exist, \fIbibtex\fR is run to generate .bbl files
as needed, and then it is appropriate to delete the bbl files in a cleanup
operation since they can be re-generated.

This property can also be configured by setting the \fI$bibtex_use\fR
variable to 1.5 in a configuration file.

\fBNote\fR that when \fBbiber\fR is used, and a bib file doesn't exist, this
option does not prevent \fIbiber\fR from being run, with the bbl file then
being incorrect. 
See the
documentation on \fI$bibtex_use\fR for more details.  However, a bbl file
is treated as precious in a clean up operation.

.TP
.B -bibtexfudge\fR or\fB -bibfudge
Turn on the change-directory fudge for bibtex.  See documentation of
\fI$bibtex_fudge\fR for details.

.TP
.B -bibtexfudge-\fR or\fB -bibfudge-
Turn off the change-directory fudge for
bibtex.  See documentation of \fI$bibtex_fudge\fR for details.

.TP
.B -bm <message>
A banner message to print diagonally across each page when converting
the dvi file to postscript.  The message must be a single argument on
the command line so be careful with quoting spaces and such.

Note that if the \fB-bm\fR option is specified, the \fB-ps\fR option is
assumed.

.TP
.B -bi <intensity>
How dark to print the banner message.  A decimal number between 0 and 1.
0 is black and 1 is white.  The default is 0.95, which is OK unless your
toner cartridge is getting low.

.TP
.B -bs <scale>
A decimal number that specifies how large the banner message will be
printed.  Experimentation is necessary to get the right scale for your
message, as a rule of thumb the scale should be about equal to 1100
divided by the number of characters in the message.  The default is 220.0
which is just right for 5 character messages.

.TP 
.B -commands
List the commands used by \fIlatexmk\fR for processing files, and then
exit. 

.TP 
.B -c
Clean up (remove) all regeneratable files generated by \fIlatex\fR and
\fIbibtex\fR or \fIbiber\fR except dvi, postscript and pdf.  These files are a
combination of log files, aux files, \fIlatexmk\fR's database file of
source file information, 
and those with extensions
specified in the \fI@generated_exts\fR configuration variable.  In addition,
files specified by the \fI$clean_ext\fR and \fI@generated_exts\fR
configuration variables are removed.

This cleanup is instead of a regular make.  See the \fB-gg\fR option
if you want to do a cleanup followed by a make.

\fITreatment of .bbl files: \fR If \fI$bibtex_use\fR is set to 0 or 1,
bbl files are always treated as non-regeneratable.  If
\fI$bibtex_use\fR is set to 1.5, bbl files are counted as
non-regeneratable conditionally: If the bib file exists, then bbl
files are regeneratable, and are deleted in a clean up.  But if
\fI$bibtex_use\fR is 1.5 and a bib file doesn't exist, then the bbl
files are treated as non-regeneratable and hence are not deleted.

In contrast, if \fI$bibtex_use\fR is set to 2, bbl files are always
treated as regeneratable, and are deleted in a cleanup.

\fITreatment of files generated by custom dependencies:\fR If
\fI$cleanup_includes_cusdep_generated\fR is nonzero, regeneratable
files are considered as including those generated by custom
dependencies and are also deleted.  Otherwise these files are not
deleted.

.TP 
.B -C
Clean up (remove) all regeneratable files generated by \fIlatex\fR and
\fIbibtex\fR or \fIbiber\fR.  This is the same as the \fB-c\fR option with the
addition of dvi, postscript and pdf files, and those specified
in the \fI$clean_full_ext\fR configuration variable.

This cleanup is instead of a regular make.  See the \fB-gg\fR option
if you want to do a cleanup followed by a make.

See the \fB-c\fR option for the specification of whether or not .bbl
files are treated as non-regeneratable or regeneratable. 

If \fI$cleanup_includes_cusdep_generated\fR is nonzero, regeneratable
files are considered as including those generated by custom
dependencies and are also deleted.  Otherwise these files are not deleted.

.TP 
.B -CA
(Obsolete).  Now equivalent to the \fB-C\fR option.  See that option
for details. 

.TP 
.B -cd
Change to the directory containing the main source file before processing
it.  Then all the generated files (.aux, .log, .dvi, .pdf, etc) will be
relative to the source file.  

This option is particularly useful when \fIlatexmk\fR is invoked from
a GUI configured to invoke \fIlatexmk\fR with a full pathname for the
source file.

This option works by setting the \fB$do_cd\fR configuration variable
to one; you can set that variable if you want to configure
\fIlatexmk\fR to have the effect of the \fB-cd\fR option without
specifying it on the command line.  See the documentation for that
variable.

.TP 
.B -cd-
Do NOT change to the directory containing the main source file before processing
it.  Then all the generated files (.aux, .log, .dvi, .pdf, etc) will be
relative to the current directory rather than the source file.  

This is the default behavior and corresponds to the behavior of the
\fI*latex\fR programs.  However, it is not desirable
behavior when \fIlatexmk\fR is invoked by a GUI configured to invoke
\fIlatexmk\fR with a full pathname for the source file.  See the
\fB-cd\fR option.

This option works by setting the \fB$do_cd\fR configuration variable
to zero.  See the documentation for that variable for more
information.

.TP 
.B -CF
Remove the file containing the database of source file information,
before doing the other actions requested.

.TP 
.B -d
Set draft mode.  This prints the banner message "DRAFT" across your
page when converting the dvi file to postscript.  Size and intensity
can be modified with the \fB-bs\fR and \fB-bi\fR options.  The \fB-bm\fR
option will override this option as this is really just a short way of
specifying:

	latexmk -bm DRAFT

Note that if the \fB-d\fR option is specified, the \fB-ps\fR option is
assumed.

.TP
.B -deps 
Show a list of dependent files after processing.  This is in the form
of a dependency list of the form used by the \fImake\fR program, and
it is therefore suitable for use in a Makefile.  It gives an overall
view of the files without listing intermediate files, as well as
\fIlatexmk\fR can determine them.

By default the list of dependent files is sent to stdout (i.e.,
normally to the screen unless you've redirected \fIlatexmk\fR's
output). But you can set the filename where the list is sent by the
\fB-deps-out=\fR option.

See the section "USING \fIlatexmk\fR WITH \fImake\fR" for
an example of how to use a dependency list with \fImake\fR.  

Users familiar with GNU \fIautomake\fR and \fIgcc\fR will find that
the \fB-deps\fR option is very similar in its purpose and results to
the \fB-M\fR option to \fIgcc\fR.  (In fact, \fIlatexmk\fR also has
options \fB-M\fR, \fB-MF\fR, and \fB-MP\fR options that behave like
those of \fIgcc\fR.)

.TP
.B -dependents
Equivalent to \fB-deps\fR.

.TP
.B -deps-  
Do not show a list of dependent files after processing.  (This is the
default.) 

.TP
.B -dependents-
Equivalent to \fB-deps-\fR.

.TP
.B -deps-escape=<string>
Set the kind of escaping used for spaces in the dependency list.  The
possible values are "none", "unix", "nmake", corresponding respectively to
no escaping, escaping with a "\\" suitable for standard Unix make, and
escaping with "^", suitable for Microsoft's nmake.  

.TP
.B -deps-out=FILENAME  
Set the filename to which the list of dependent files is written.  If
the FILENAME argument is omitted or set to "-", then the output is
sent to stdout. 

Use of this option also turns on the output of the list of dependent
files after processing.

.TP
.B -dF
Dvi file filtering.  The argument to this option is a filter which will
generate a filtered dvi file with the extension ".dviF".  All extra
processing (e.g. conversion to postscript, preview, printing) will then
be performed on this filtered dvi file.

Example usage: To use dviselect to select only the even pages of the dvi file:

	latexmk -dF "dviselect even" foo.tex

.TP
.B -diagnostics
Print detailed diagnostics during a run.  This may help for debugging
problems or to understand \fIlatexmk\fR's behavior in difficult
situations. 

.TP
.B -dir-report
For each .tex file processed, list the settings for aux and out
directories, after they have been normalized from the settings specified
during initialization. See the description of the variable
\fB$aux_out_dir_report\fR for more details.

.TP
.B -dir-report-
Do not report the settings for aux and out directories.  (Default)

.TP
.B -dir-report-only
After all initialization is complete, give the settings for the aux and out
directories, and then halt.  This option is primarily used for debugging
configuration issues.

.TP
.B -dvi
Generate dvi version of document using latex.
(And turn off any incompatible requests.)

.TP
.B -dvilua
Generate dvi version of document using lualatex instead of latex.
(And turn off any incompatible requests.)

.TP
.B -dvi-
Turn off generation of dvi version of document.  (This may get
overridden, if some other file is made (e.g., a .ps file) that is
generated from the dvi file, or if no generated file at all is
requested.) 

.TP
.B -dvilualatex="COMMAND"
This sets the string specifying the command to run \fIdvi lualatex\fR.  It
behaves like the \fB-pdflatex\fR option, but sets the variable
\fI$dvilualatex\fR.  

\fINote: This option when provided with the COMMAND argument only sets the
command for invoking dvilualatex; it does not turn on the use of
dvilualatex. That is done by other options or in an initialization file.\fR

.TP
.B -e <code>
Execute the specified initialization code before processing.  The code
is \fIPerl\fR code of the same form as is used in \fIlatexmk\fR's
initialization files.  For more details,
see the information on the
\fB-r\fR option, and the section about "Configuration/initialization
(RC) files".  The code is typically a sequence of assignment
statements separated by semicolons.

The code is executed when the \fB-e\fR option is encountered during
\fIlatexmk\fR's parsing of its command line.  See the \fB-r\fR option
for a way of executing initialization code from a file.  An error
results in \fIlatexmk\fR stopping.  Multiple instances of the \fB-r\fR
and \fB-e\fR options can be used, and they are executed in the order
they appear on the command line.

Some care is needed to deal with proper quoting of special characters
in the code on the command line.  For example, suppose you want
to set the latex command to use its -shell-escape option, then under
UNIX/Linux you could use the line

	latexmk -e '$latex=q/latex %O -shell-escape %S/' file.tex

Note that the single quotes block normal UNIX/Linux command shells
from treating the characters inside the quotes as special.
(In this example, the q/.../ construct is a
\fIPerl\fR idiom equivalent to using 
single quotes.  This avoids the complications of getting a quote
character inside an already quoted string in a way that is independent
of both the shell and the operating-system.)

The above command line will NOT work under MS-Windows with cmd.exe or
command.com or 4nt.exe.  For MS-Windows with these command shells you
could use

	latexmk -e "$latex=q/latex %O -shell-escape %S/" file.tex

or

	latexmk -e "$latex='latex %O -shell-escape %S'" file.tex

The last two examples will NOT work with UNIX/Linux command shells.

(\fINote\fR: the above examples show are to show how to use the
\fB-e\fR to specify initialization code to be executed.  But the
particular effect can be achieved also by the use of the \fB-latex\fR
option with less problems in dealing with quoting.)

.TP
.B -emulate-aux-dir
Emulate the use of an aux directory instead of leaving it to the *latex
programs to do it.  (MiKTeX supports -aux-directory, but TeXLive doesn't.)

See the section AUXILIARY AND OUTPUT DIRECTORIES for more details.

.TP
.B -emulate-aux-dir-
Turn off emulation to implement an aux directory and leave it to the *latex
program to handle the case that the aux directory is different from the
output directory.  Note that if you use TeXLive, which doesn't support
-aux-directory, latexmk will automatically switch aux_dir emulation on
after the first run of *latex, because it will find the .log file in the
wrong place.

.TP
.B -f
Force \fIlatexmk\fR to continue document processing despite errors.
Normally, when \fIlatexmk\fR detects that LaTeX or another program has
found an error which will not be resolved by further processing, no
further processing is carried out.

Note: "Further processing" means the running of other programs or the
rerunning of \fIlatex\fR (etc) that would be done if no errors had
occurred.  If instead, or additionally, you want the \fIlatex\fR (etc)
program not to pause for user input after an error, you should arrange
this by an option that is passed to the program, e.g., by
\fIlatexmk\fR's option \fB-interaction=nonstopmode\fR (which \fIlatexmk\fR
passes to \fI*latex\fR). 

.TP
.B -f-
Turn off the forced processing-past-errors such as is set by the
\fB-f\fR option.  This could be used to override a setting in a
configuration file.

.TP
.B -g
Force \fIlatexmk\fR to process document fully, even under situations
where \fIlatexmk\fR would normally decide that no changes in the
source files have occurred since the previous run. 
This option is useful, for example, if you change some options and
wish to reprocess the files.

.TP
.B -g-
Turn off \fB-g\fR.

.TP
.B -gg
"Super go mode" or "clean make": clean out generated files as if
\fB-C\fR had been given, and then do a regular make.

.TP
.B -h \fRor\fB-non-help
Print help information.

.TP
.B -hnt
Generate hnt (HINT) version of document using hilatex.
(And turn off any incompatible requests.)

.TP
.B -jobname=STRING
Set the basename of output files(s) to STRING, instead of the default,
which is the basename of the specified TeX file.  (At present, STRING
should not contain spaces.)

This is like the same option for current implementations of the
\fI*latex\fR, and the passing of this option to
these programs is part of \fIlatexmk\fR's implementation of
\fB-jobname\fR.

There is one enhancement, that the STRING may contain the
placeholder '%A'. This will be substituted by the basename of the TeX
file.  The primary purpose is when multiple files are specified on the
command line to \fIlatexmk\fR, and you wish to use a jobname with a
different file-dependent value for each file.  For example, suppose
you had .tex files test1.tex and test2.tex, and you wished to compare
the results of compilation by \fI*latex\fR and those with
\fIxelatex\fR.  Then under a unix-type operating system you could use
the command line 

    latexmk -pdf -jobname=%A-pdflatex *.tex
    latexmk -pdfxe -jobname=%A-xelatex *.tex

Then the .aux, .log, and .pdf files from the use of \fIpdflatex\fR
would have basenames test1-pdflatex and test2-pdflatex, while from
\fIxelatex\fR, the basenames would be test1-xelatex and test2-xelatex.

Under MS-Windows with cmd.exe, you would need to double the percent
sign, so that the percent character is passed to latexmk rather than
being used to substitute an environment variable:

    latexmk -pdf -jobname=%%A-pdflatex *.tex
    latexmk -pdfxe -jobname=%%A-xelatex *.tex

.TP
.B -l
Run in landscape mode, using the landscape mode for the previewers and
the dvi to postscript converters.  This option is not normally needed
nowadays, since current previewers normally determine this information
automatically. 

.TP
.B -l-
Turn off \fB-l\fR.

.TP
.B -latex
This sets the generation of dvi files by \fIlatex\fR, and turns off the
generation of pdf and ps files.

\fINote: to set the \fRcommand\fI used when latex is specified, see the
\fB-latex="COMMAND"\fI option.\fR

.TP
.B -latex="COMMAND"
This sets the string specifying the command to run latex, and is
typically used to add desired options.  Since the string normally
contains spaces, it should be quoted, e.g.,

     latexmk -latex="latex --shell-escape %O %S"  foo.tex

The specification of the contents of the string are the same as for
the \fI$latex\fR configuration variable.  Depending on your
operating system and the command-line shell you are using, you may
need to change the single quotes to double quotes (or something
else). 

\fINote: This option when provided with the COMMAND argument only sets the
command for invoking latex; it does not turn on the use of
latex. That is done by other options or in an initialization file.\fR

To set the command for running \fIpdflatex\fR (rather than the command for
\fIlatex\fR) see the \fB-pdflatex\fR option.

.TP
.B -logfilewarninglist
.B -logfilewarnings
After a run of \fI*latex\fR, give a list of warnings about
undefined citations and references (unless silent mode is on).

See also the \fI$silence_logfile_warnings\fR configuration variable.

.TP
.B -logfilewarninglist-
.B -logfilewarnings-
After a run of \fI*latex\fR, do not give a list of warnings about
undefined citations and references.  (Default)

See also the \fI$silence_logfile_warnings\fR configuration variable.

.TP
.B -lualatex
Use \fIlualatex\fR.  That is, use \fIlualatex\fR to process the source file(s) to
pdf.  The generation of dvi, hnt, postscript and xdv files is turned off.

This option is equivalent to using the following set of options

     -pdflua -dvi- -ps-

(\fINote\fR: Note that the method of implementation of this option,
but not its intended effect, differ from some earlier versions of
\fIlatexmk\fR.)

.TP
.B -lualatex="COMMAND"
This sets the string specifying the command to run \fIlualatex\fR.  It
behaves like the \fB-pdflatex\fR option, but sets the variable
\fI$lualatex\fR.  

\fINote: This option when provided with the COMMAND argument only sets the
command for invoking lualatex; it does not turn on the use of
lualatex. That is done by other options or in an initialization file.\fR

.TP
.B -M
Show list of dependent files after processing.  This is equivalent to
the \fB-deps\fR option.

.TP
.B -MF file
If a list of dependents is made, the \fB-MF\fR specifies the file to
write it to. 

.TP
.B -MP
If a list of dependents is made, include a phony target for each source
file.  If you use the dependents list in a Makefile, the dummy rules
work around errors the program \fImake\fR gives if you remove header
files without updating the Makefile to match.

.TP
.B -makeindexfudge
Turn on the change-directory fudge for makeindex.  See documentation of
\fI$makeindex_fudge\fR for details.

.TP
.B -makeindexfudge-
Turn off the change-directory fudge for makeindex.  See documentation of
\fI$makeindex_fudge\fR for details.

.TP
.B $min_sleep_time [0.01]
This is the minimum nonzero value allowed for \fI$sleep_time\fR.

.TP
.B -MSWinBackSlash
This option only has an effect when \fIlatexmk\fR is running under
MS-Windows.  This is that when \fIlatexmk\fR runs a command under
MS-Windows, the Windows standard directory separator "\\" is used to
separate directory components in a file name.  Internally, \fIlatexmk\fR
uses "/" for the directory separator character, which is the character used
by Unix-like systems.

This is the default behavior.  However the default may have been overridden
by a configuration file (latexmkrc file) which sets
\fI$MSWin_back_slash=0\fR.

.TP
.B -MSWinBackSlash-
This option only has an effect when \fIlatexmk\fR is running under
MS-Windows.  This is that when \fIlatexmk\fR runs a command under
MS-Windows, the substitution of "\\" for the separator character between
directory components of a file name is \fInot\fR done. Instead the forward
slash "/" is used, the same as on Unix-like systems. This is acceptable in
most situations under MS-Windows, provided that filenames are properly
quoted, as \fIlatexmk\fR does by default.

See the documentation for the configuration variable
\fI$MSWin_back_slash\fR for more details.

.TP
.B -new-viewer
When in continuous-preview mode, always start a new viewer to view the
generated file.  By default, \fIlatexmk\fR will, in continuous-preview
mode, test for a previously running previewer for the same file and
not start a new one if a previous previewer is running.  However, its
test sometimes fails (notably if there is an already-running previewer
that is viewing a file of the same name as the current file, but in a
different directory).  This option turns off the default behavior.

.TP
.B -new-viewer-
The inverse of the \fB-new-viewer\fR option.  It puts \fIlatexmk\fR
in its normal behavior that in preview-continuous mode it checks for
an already-running previewer.  

.TP
.B -nobibtex
Never run bibtex or biber.  Equivalent to the \fB-bibtex-\fR option.

.TP
.B -nobibtexfudge \fRor\fB -nobibfudge
Turn off the change-directory fudge for
bibtex.  See documentation of \fI$bibtex_fudge\fR for details.

.TP
.B -noemulate-aux-dir
Turn aux_dir emulation off.  Same as \fI-emulate-aux-dir-\fR.

.TP
.B -nomakeindexfudge
Turn off the change-directory fudge for makeindex.  See documentation of
\fI$makeindex_fudge\fR for details.

.TP
.B -norc
Turn off the automatic reading of initialization (rc) files.

N.B. Normally the initialization files are read and obeyed, and then
command line options are obeyed in the order they are encountered.
But \fB-norc\fR is an exception to this rule: it is acted on first,
no matter where it occurs on the command line.

.TP
.B -outdir=FOO \fRor\fB -output-directory=FOO

Sets the directory for the output files of *latex.

If the aux directory is not set or is the same as the output directory,
then all output files of *latex are sent to the output directory.

If the aux directory is set, e.g., by the option \fB-auxdir\fR, and is not
equal to the output directory, then only the primary output files
(.dvi, .ps, .pdf, .synctex, .synctex.gz) are sent to the output
directory. Other generated files are sent to the aux directory.

See the section AUXILIARY AND OUTPUT DIRECTORIES for more details.

.TP
.B -out2dir=FOO

(\fIExperimental new feature.\fR)

Sets the directory for the final output files of a whole round of
compilations.

The use of this directory solves, among other things, the problem that when
multiple runs of *latex and other programs are needed, files like the main
pdf file from pdflatex, etc will be changed multiple times. A viewer like
SumatraPDF that reloads the file whenever it detects changes will show a
distracting sequence of intermediate states of the pdf file, rather than
just the final version after all the repeated runs of *latex etc have been
done.  Instead, when a distinct final-output directory is set, by the
\fB-out2dir\fR option or the equivalent \fI$out2_dir\fR variable is set,
the viewer will only see a changed pdf (etc) file after full sequence of
repeated runs of *latex etc has finished.

By default the final output directory is the same as the output directory
(as specified by the \fB-outdir\fR option or the setting of the variable
\fI$out_dir\fR configuration variable).


.TP
.B -output-format=FORMAT
This option is one that is allowed for \fIlatex\fR, \fIlualatex\fR, and
\fIpdflatex\fR. But it is not passed to these programs.  Instead
\fIlatexmk\fR emulates it in a way suitable for the context of
\fIlatexmk\fR and its workflows.

-If FORMAT is dvi, then dvi output is turned on, and postscript, pdf and xdv
output are turned off. This is equivalent to using the options \fB-dvi -ps-
-pdf- -xdv-\fR.

If FORMAT is pdf, then pdf output is turned on, and dvi, postscript and xdv
output are turned off. This is equivalent to using the options \fB-pdf -ps-
-dvi- -xdv-\fR.

If FORMAT is anything else, \fIlatexmk\fR gives an error.

.TP
.B -p
Print out the document.  By default the file to be printed is
the first in the list postscript, pdf, dvi that is being made.
But you can use the
\fB-print=...\fR option to change the type of file to be printed, and you
can configure this in a start up file (by setting the
\fI$print_type\fR variable).  

However, printing is enabled by default only under UNIX/Linux systems,
where the default is to use the lpr command and only on postscript
files.  In general, the correct
behavior for printing very much depends on your system's software.  In
particular, under MS-Windows you must have suitable program(s)
available, and you must have configured the print commands used by
\fIlatexmk\fR.  This can be non-trivial.  See the documentation on the
\fI$lpr\fR, \fI$lpr_dvi\fR, and \fI$lpr_pdf\fR configuration variables
to see how to set the commands for printing.

This option is incompatible with the \fB-pv\fR and \fB-pvc\fR options,
so it turns them off. 

.TP
.B -pdf
Generate pdf version of document using \fIpdflatex\fR.
(And turn off any incompatible requests.)

(If you wish
to use \fIlualatex\fR or \fIxelatex\fR, you can use whichever of the
options \fB-pdflua\fR, \fB-pdfxe\fR, \fB-lualatex\fR or \fB-xelatex\fR
applies.)  To configure 
\fIlatexmk\fR to have such behavior by default, see the section on 
"Configuration/initialization (rc) files".

.TP
.B -pdfdvi
Generate dvi file and then pdf version of document from the dvi file, by
default using dvipdf. 
(And turn off any incompatible requests.)

The program used to compile the document to dvi is \fIlatex\fR by default,
but this can be changed to \fIdvilulatex\fR by the use of the \fB-dvilua\fR
option or by setting \fI$dvi_mode\fR to 2.

.TP
.B -pdflua
Generate pdf version of document using \fIlualatex\fR.
(And turn off any incompatible requests.)

.TP
.B -pdfps
Generate dvi file, ps file from the dvi file,  and then pdf file from the
ps file.
(And turn off any incompatible requests.)

The program used to compile the document to dvi is \fIlatex\fR by default,
but this can be changed to \fIdvilulatex\fR by the use of the \fB-dvilua\fR
option or by setting \fI$dvi_mode\fR to 2.

.TP
.B -pdfxe
Generate pdf version of document using \fIxelatex\fR.
(And turn off any incompatible requests.)

Note that to
optimize processing time, \fIlatexmk\fR uses \fIxelatex\fR to generate
an .xdv file rather than a pdf file directly.  Only after possibly
multiple runs to generate a fully up-to-date .xdv file does \fIlatexmk\fR
then call \fIxdvipdfmx\fR to generate the final .pdf file.

(\fINote:\fR The reason why \fIlatexmk\fR arranges for \fIxelatex\fR to
make an .xdv file instead of the \fIxelatex\fR's default of a .pdf file is
as follows: When the document includes large graphics files,
especially .png files, the production of a .pdf file can be quite time
consuming, even when the creation of the .xdv file by \fIxelatex\fR is
fast.  So the use of the intermediate .xdv file can result in substantial
gains in procesing time, since the .pdf file is produced once rather than
on every run of \fIxelatex\fR.)

.TP
.B -pdf-
Turn off generation of pdf version of document.  
(This can be used to override a setting in a configuration file.
It may get overridden if some other option requires the generation of
a pdf file.)

If after all options have been processed, pdf generation is still
turned off, then generation of a dvi file will be turned on, and then
the program used to compiled a document will be \fIlatex\fR (or, more
precisely, whatever program is configured to be used in the
\fI$latex\fR configuration variable).

.TP
.B -pdflatex
Set the generation of pdf files by \fIpdflatex\fR.
(And turn off any incompatible requests.)

\fINote: to set the \fRcommand\fI used when pdflatex is specified, see the
\fB-pdflatex="COMMAND"\fI option.\fR

.TP
.B -pdflatex="COMMAND"
This sets the string specifying the command to run \fIpdflatex\fR, and is
typically used to add desired options.  Since the string normally
contains spaces, it should be quoted, e.g.,

     latexmk -pdf -pdflatex="pdflatex --shell-escape %O %S"  foo.tex

The specification of the contents of the string are the same as for
the \fI$pdflatex\fR configuration variable.  (The option
\fB-pdflatex\fR in fact sets the variable \fI$pdflatex\fR.)
Depending on your
operating system and the command-line shell you are using, you may
need to change the single quotes to double quotes (or something
else). 

\fINote: This option when provided with the COMMAND argument only sets the
command for invoking pdflatex; it does not turn on the use of
pdflatex. That is done by other options or in an initialization file.\fR

To set the command for running \fIlatex\fR (rather than the command
for \fIpdflatex\fR) see the \fB-latex\fR option.

.TP
.B -pdflualatex="COMMAND"
Equivalent to \fB-lualatex="COMMAND"\fR.

.TP
.B -pdfxelatex="COMMAND"
Equivalent to \fB-xelatex="COMMAND"\fR.

.TP
.B -pretex=CODE

Given that CODE is some TeX code, this options sets that code to be
executed before inputting source file.  This only works if the command
for invoking the relevant \fI*latex\fR is suitably configured.  See
the documentation of the variable \fI$pre_tex_code\fR, and the
substitution strings %P and %U for more details.  This option works by
setting the variable \fI$pre_tex_code\fR.

See also the \fB-usepretex\fR option.

An example:

    latexmk -pretex='\\AtBeginDocument{Message\\par}' -usepretex foo.tex

But this is better written

    latexmk -usepretex='\\AtBeginDocument{Message\\par}' foo.tex

If you already have a suitable command configured, you only need

    latexmk -pretex='\\AtBeginDocument{Message\\par}' foo.tex

.TP
.B -print=dvi\fR,\fB -print=ps\fR,\fB -print=pdf\fR,\fB -print=auto,
Define which kind of file is printed.  This option also ensures that
the requisite file is made, and turns on printing.

The (default) case
\fB-print=auto\fR determines the kind of print file automatically from
the set of files that is being made.  The first in the list
postscript, pdf, dvi that is among the files to be made is the one
used for print out.

.TP
.B -ps
Generate postscript version of document.
(And turn off any incompatible requests.)

.TP
.B -ps-
Turn off generation of postscript version of document.
This can be used to override a setting in a configuration file.
(It may get overridden by some other option that requires a postscript
file, for example a request for printing.)

.TP
.B -pF
Postscript file filtering.  The argument to this option is a filter
which will generate a filtered postscript file with the extension
".psF".  All extra processing (e.g. preview, printing) will then be
performed on this filtered postscript file.

Example of usage: Use psnup to print two pages on the one page:

	latexmk -ps -pF 'psnup -2' foo.tex

or

	latexmk -ps -pF "psnup -2" foo.tex

Whether to use single or double quotes round the "psnup -2" will
depend on your command interpreter, as used by the particular version
of perl and the operating system on your computer.

.TP
.B -pv
Run file previewer.  If the \fB-view\fR option is used, that will select
the kind of file to be previewed (.pdf, .ps or .dvi).  Otherwise the viewer
views the "highest" kind of output file that is made, with the ordering
being .pdf, .ps, .dvi (high to low).  This option is incompatible with the
\fB-p\fR and \fB-pvc\fR options, so it turns them off.

.TP
.B -pv-
Turn off \fB-pv\fR.

.TP
.B -pvc
Run a file previewer and continually update the .dvi, .ps, and/or .pdf
files whenever changes are made to source files (see the Description
above).  Which of these files is generated and which is viewed is
governed by the other options, and is the same as for the \fB-pv\fR
option. 
The preview-continuous option \fB-pvc\fR can only work with one file.
So in this case you will normally only specify one filename on
the command line.  It is also incompatible with the 
\fB-p\fR and \fB-pv\fR options, so it turns these options off.

The \fB-pvc\fR option also turns off force mode (\fB-f\fR), as is
normally best for continuous preview mode.  If you really want force
mode, use the options in the order \fB-pvc -f\fR.

With a good previewer the display will be automatically updated.
(Under \fIsome but not all\fR versions of UNIX/Linux "gv -watch" does
this for postscript files; this can be set by a configuration
variable.  This would also work for pdf files except for an apparent
bug in gv that causes an error when the newly updated pdf file is
read.)  Many other previewers will need a manual update.

\fBImportant note\fR: the acroread program on MS-Windows locks the pdf file,
and prevents new versions being written, so it is a bad idea to use
acroread to view pdf files in preview-continuous mode.  
It is better to use a different viewer: \fISumatraPDF\fR and
\fIgsview\fR are good possibilities. 

There are some other methods for arranging an update, notably useful
for many versions of \fIxdvi\fR and \fIxpdf\fR.  These are best set in
\fIlatexmk\fR's configuration; see below. 

Note that if \fIlatexmk\fR dies or is stopped by the user, the
"forked" previewer will continue to run.  Successive invocations with
the \fB-pvc\fR option will not fork new previewers, but \fIlatexmk\fR
will normally use the existing previewer.  (At least this will happen
when \fIlatexmk\fR is running under an operating system where it knows
how to determine whether an existing previewer is running.)

.TP
.B -pvc-
Turn off \fB-pvc\fR.

.TP
.B -pvctimeout
Do timeout in pvc mode after period of inactivity, which is 30 min. by
default.  Inactivity means a period when \fIlatexmk\fR has detected no
file changes and hence has not taken any actions like compiling the
document. 

.TP
.B -pvctimeout-
Don't do timeout in pvc mode after inactivity.

.TP
.B -pvctimeoutmins=<time>
Set period of inactivity in \fIminutes\fR for pvc timeout.

.TP
.B -quiet
Same as -silent

.TP
.B -r <rcfile>
Read the specified initialization file ("RC file") before processing.

Be careful about the ordering: (1) Standard initialization files --
see the section below on "Configuration/initialization (RC) files" --
are read first.  (2) Then the options on the command line are acted on
in the order they are given.  Therefore if an initialization file is
specified by the \fB-r\fR option, it is read during this second step.
Thus an initialization file specified with the \fB-r\fR option can
override both the standard initialization files and \fIpreviously\fR
specified options.  But all of these can be overridden by \fIlater\fR
options.

The contents of the RC file just comprise a piece of code in the
\fIPerl\fR programming language
(typically a sequence of assignment statements); they are executed
when the \fB-r\fR option is encountered during \fIlatexmk\fR's parsing
of its command line.  See the \fB-e\fR option for a way of giving
initialization code directly on \fIlatexmk\fR's command line.  An
error results in \fIlatexmk\fR stopping.  Multiple instances of the
\fB-r\fR and \fB-e\fR options can be used, and they are executed in
the order they appear on the command line.

.TP
.B -rc-report
After initialization, give a list of the RC files read. (Default)

.TP
.B -rc-report-
After initialization, do not give a list of the RC files read.

.TP
.B -recorder
Give the -recorder option with \fI*latex\fR.  In
(most) modern versions of these programs, this results in a file of
extension \fI.fls\fR containing a list of the files that these
programs have read and written.  \fILatexmk\fR will then use this file
to improve its detection of source files and generated files after a
run of \fI*latex\fR.  This is the default setting of
\fIlatexmk\fR, unless overridden in an initialization file.

For further information, see the documentation for the \fI$recorder\fR
configuration variable.

.TP
.B -recorder-
Do not supply the -recorder option with \fI*latex\fR.

.TP
.B -rules 
Show a list of \fIlatemk\fR's rules and dependencies after processing.

.TP
.B -rules-  
Do not show a list of \fIlatexmk\fR's rules and dependencies after
processing.  (This is the default.)

.TP
.B -showextraoptions
Show the list of extra \fI*latex\fR options that
\fIlatexmk\fR recognizes, but that it simply passes
through to the programs \fI*latex\fR  when they
are run.  These options are 
(currently) a combination of those allowed by the TeXLive and MiKTeX
implementations.  (If a particular option is given to \fIlatexmk\fR
but is not handled by the particular implementation of \fI*latex\fR
that is being used, that program will probably give a warning or an
error.)  These options are very numerous, but are not listed
in this documentation because they have no effect on \fIlatexmk\fR's
actions.

There are a few options (e.g., \fB-includedirectory=dir\fR,
\fB-initialize\fR, \fB-ini\fR) that are not recognized, either because
they don't fit with \fIlatexmk\fR's intended operations, or because
they need special processing by \fIlatexmk\fR that isn't implemented
(at least, not yet).

There are certain options for \fI*latex\fR (e.g., \fB-recorder\fR) that
trigger special actions or behavior by \fIlatexmk\fR itself. Depending on
the action, they may also be passed in some form to the called \fI*latex\fR
program, and/or may affect other programs as well.  These options do have
entries in this documentation.  Among these options are:
\fB-jobname=STRING\fR, \fB-aux-directory=dir\fR,
\fB-output-directory=DIR\fR, \fB-quiet\fR, and \fB-recorder\fR.

There are also options that are accepted by \fI*latex\fR, but
instead trigger actions purely by \fIlatexmk\fR: \fB-help\fR,
\fB-version\fR. 

.TP
.B -silent
Run commands silently, i.e., with options that reduce the amount of
diagnostics generated.  For example, with the default settings, the
command "latex -interaction=batchmode" is used for \fIlatex\fR,
and similarly for its friends.

See also the \fB-logfilewarninglist\fR and \fB-logfilewarninglist-\fR
options. 

Also reduce the number of informational messages that \fIlatexmk\fR
itself generates. 

To change the options used to make the commands run silently, you need
to configure \fIlatexmk\fR with changed values of its configuration
variables, the relevant ones being \fI$bibtex_silent_switch\fR,
\fI$biber_silent_switch\fR, \fI$dvipdf_silent_switch\fR, 
\fI$dvips_silent_switch\fR, \fI$dvilualatex_silent_switch\fR,
\fI$latex_silent_switch\fR, \fI$lualatex_silent_switch\fR
\fI$makeindex_silent_switch\fR, \fI$pdflatex_silent_switch\fR,
and \fI$xelatex_silent_switch\fR

.TP
.B -stdtexcmds
Sets the commands for \fIlatex\fR, etc, so that they are the standard
ones. This is useful to override special configurations.

The result is that \fI$latex = 'latex %O %S'\fR, and similarly for
\fI$pdflatex\fR, \fI$lualatex\fR, and \fI$xelatex\fR.  (The option
\fB-no-pdf\fR needed for \fI$xelatex\fR is provided automatically,
given that %O appears in the definition.)

.TP
.B -time
Show time used.  (On MS Windows, what is shown is clock time; on other
systems CPU time.)
See also the configuration variable \fI$show_time\fR.

.TP
.B -time-
Do not show time used.
See also the configuration variable \fI$show_time\fR.

.TP
.B -use-make
When after a run of \fI*latex\fR, there are warnings
about missing files (e.g., as requested by the LaTeX \\input, \\include,
and \\includgraphics commands), \fIlatexmk\fR tries to make them by a custom
dependency. If no relevant custom dependency with an appropriate
source file is found, and if the \fB-use-make\fR option is set, then
as a last resort \fIlatexmk\fR will try to use the \fImake\fR program
to try to make the missing files.

Note that the filename may be specified without an extension, e.g.,
by \\includegraphics{drawing} in a LaTeX file.  In that case,
\fIlatexmk\fR will try making drawing.ext with ext set in turn to the
possible extensions that are relevant for \fIlatex\fR (or as
appropriate \fIpdflatex\fR, \fIlualatex\fR, \fIxelatex\fR).  

See also the documentation for the \fI$use_make_for_missing_files\fR
configuration variable. 

.TP
.B -use-make-
Do not use the make program to try to make missing files.  (Default.)

.TP
.B -usepretex
Sets the command lines for \fIlatex\fR, etc, so that they use the code
that is defined by the variable \fI$pre_tex_code\fR or that is set by
the option \fB-pretex=CODE\fR to execute the specified TeX code before
the source file is read.  This option overrides any previous
definition of the command lines.

The result is that \fI$latex = 'latex %O %P'\fR, and similarly for
\fI$pdflatex\fR, \fI$lualatex\fR, and \fI$xelatex\fR.  (The option
\fB-no-pdf\fR needed for \fI$xelatex\fR is provided automatically,
given that %O appears in the definition.)

.TP
.B -usepretex=CODE
Equivalent to \fB-pretex=CODE -usepretex\fR.  Example

  latexmk -usepretex='\\AtBeginDocument{Message\\par}' foo.tex

.TP
.B -v \fRor\fB -version
Print version number of \fIlatexmk\fR.

.TP
.B -verbose
Opposite of \fB-silent\fR.  This is the default setting.

.TP
.B -view=default\fR,\fB -view=dvi\fR,\fB -view=hnt\fR,\fB -view=ps\fR,\fB -view=pdf\fR,\fB -view=none
Set the kind of file used when previewing is requested (e.g., by the
\fB-pv\fR or \fB-pvc\fR switches).  The default is to view the "highest"
kind of requested file (in the low-to-high order .dvi, .hnt, .ps, .pdf).  

Note the possibility \fB-view=none\fR where no viewer is opened at
all.  One example of is use is in conjunction with the \fB-pvc\fR
option, when you want \fIlatexmk\fR to do a compilation automatically
whenever source file(s) change, but do not want a previewer to be opened.

.TP
.B -Werror
This causes \fIlatexmk\fR to return a non-zero status code if any of
the files processed gives a warning about problems with citations or
references (i.e., undefined citations or references or about multiply
defined references).  This is \fBafter\fR \fIlatexmk\fR has completed
all the runs it needs to try and resolve references and citations.
Thus \fB-Werror\fR causes \fIlatexmk\fR to treat such warnings as
errors, but only when they occur on the last run of *latex and
only after processing is complete.  Also can be set by the
configuration variable \fI$warnings_as_errors\fR. 

.TP
.B -xdv
Generate xdv version of document using xelatex.
(And turn off any incompatible requests.)

.TP
.B -xelatex
Use \fIxelatex\fR.  That is, use \fIxelatex\fR to process the source
file(s).  This will cause generation of a pdf (but indirectly through a xdv
file). 
(And turn off any incompatible requests.)

This option is equivalent to using the following option

     -pdfxe

[\fINote\fR: Note that the method of implementation of this option,
but not its intended primary effect, differ from some earlier versions
of \fIlatexmk\fR. \fILatexmk\fR first uses \fIxelatex\fR to make
an .xdv file, and does all the extra runs needed (including those of
\fIbibtex\fR, etc).  Only after that does it make the pdf file from
the .xdv file, using \fIxdvipdfmx\fR.  See the documentation for the
\fB-pdfxe\fR for why this is done.]

.TP
.B -xelatex="COMMAND"
This sets the string specifying the command to run \fIxelatex\fR.  It sets
the variable \fI$xelatex\fR.

\fIWarning\fR: It is important to ensure that the \fB-no-pdf\fR is used
when \fIxelatex\fR is invoked, since \fIlatexmk\fR expects \fIxelatex\fR to
produce an .xdv file, not a .pdf file. If you provide %O in the command
specification, this will be done automatically.  See the documentation for
the \fB-pdfxe\fR option for why \fIlatexmk\fR makes a .xdv file rather than
a .pdf file when \fIxelatex\fR is used.

An example of the use of the \fB-xelatex\fR option:

     latexmk -pdfxe -xelatex="xelatex --shell-escape %O %S"  foo.tex

\fINote: This option when provided with the COMMAND argument only sets the
command for invoking xelatex; it does not turn on the use of
lualatex. That is done by other options or in an initialization file.\fR

.PP
\fBCompatibility between options\fR

The preview-continuous option \fB-pvc\fR can only work with one file.
So in this case you will normally only specify one filename on
the command line.  
.PP
Options \fB-p\fR, \fB-pv\fR and \fB-pvc\fR are mutually exclusive.  So
each of these options turns the others off.

.SH DEALING WITH ERRORS, PROBLEMS, ETC

.PP
Some possibilities:

a. If you get a strange error, do look carefully at the output that is
on the screen and in log files.  While there is much that is
notoriously verbose in the output of \fIlatex\fR (and that is added to
by \fIlatexmk\fR), the verbosity is there for a reason: to enable the
user to diagnose problems.  \fILatexmk\fR does repeat some messages at
the end of a run that it thinks would otherwise be easy to miss in the
middle of other output. 

b. Generally, remember that \fIlatexmk\fR does its work by running
other programs.  Your first priority in dealing with errors should be
to examine what went wrong with the individual programs.  Then you
need to correct the causes of errors in the runs of these programs.
(Often these come from errors in the source document, but they could
also be about missing LaTeX packages, etc.)

c. If \fIlatexmk\fR doesn't run the programs the way you would like,
then you need to look in this documentation at the list of command
line options and then at the sections on configuration/initialization
files.  A lot of \fIlatexmk\fR's behavior is configurable to deal with
particular situations.  (But there is a lot of reading!)

\fIThe remainder of these notes consists of ideas for dealing with more
difficult situations.\fR

d. Further tricks can involve replacing the standard commands that
\fIlatexmk\fR runs by other commands or scripts.

e. For possible examples of code for use in an RC file, see the
directory example_rcfiles in the distribution of \fIlatexmk\fR (e.g.,
at http://mirror.ctan.org/support/latexmk/example_rcfiles).
Even if these examples don't do what you want, they may provide
suitable inspiration.

f. There's a useful trick that can be used when you use \fIlualatex\fR
instead of \fIpdflatex\fR (and in some related situations).  The
problem is that \fIlatexmk\fR won't notice a dependency on a file,
bar.baz say, that is input by the lua code in your document instead of
by the LaTeX part.  (Thus if you change bar.baz and rerun
\fIlatexmk\fR, then \fIlatexmk\fR will think no files have changed and
not rerun \fIlualatex\fR, whereas if you had '\\input{bar.baz}' in the
LaTeX part of the document, \fIlatexmk\fR would notice the change.)
One solution is just to put the following somewhere in the LaTeX part
of the document:

              \\typeout{(bar.baz)}

This puts a line in the log file that \fIlatexmk\fR will treat as
implying that the file bar.baz was read.  (At present I don't know a
way of doing this automatically.)  Of course, if the file has a
different name, change bar.baz to the name of your file.

.SH AUXILIARY AND OUTPUT DIRECTORIES

Running *latex and the associated programs generate a number of files, it
is often convenient to arrange for the generated files to be in a different
directory than the source file(s) of a document.  For our purposes here, we
identify two classes of generated file.

One class is what one may term the final output files, for example,
the .pdf file generated by running pdflatex, or the .dvi file from
latex. Also in this class is the ps file generated by applying dvips to
a .dvi file. There are also .synctec or .synctex.gz files that can be used
by programs that display .pdf files and the like to relate positions in
them to positions in source files.

The second class of file is composed of all other generated files: These
include notably .aux files that are used for implementing cross referencing,
and are both generated on one run and read on a later run.  Many packages
generate yet more such intermediate files, as well as programs like bibtex,
makeindex, etc.  There are also .log files from *latex and corresponding
files from other programs.

Let us use the term "output directory" for the directory that receives the
final output files, and "aux directory" for the directory for the other
generated files.  If no special options are provided to the *latex
programs, these directories default to the current directory, and then the
generated files aren't segregated.  If the two directories are the same, as
is the simplest situation, then all generated files are written to the same
directory, and one often simply refers to the output directory, without
mentioning a separate aux directory.

Support for them is provided for them in the *latex programs: by the single
option \fB-output-directory\fR for the TeXLive implementations, and by the
options \fB-aux-directory\fR and \fB-output-directory\fR for the MiKTeX
implementations.  Special support like this is needed for two reasons:
First is that there are many packages that write files and it needs to be
arranged that these are automatically written to the appropriate directory
without any rewriting of the packages' code.  Second is that the files are
often read in again on subsequent runs of *latex, and it is necessary that
the program knows where to find the files.

A complication is that the TeXLive implementation does not allow for
separate aux and output directories.  Latexmk deals with this by being able
to emulating a separate aux directory: In this method it invokes *latex
with just an \fB-output-directory\fR option, with the directory set not to
the desired output directory, but to the aux directory.  After running
*latex, it moves the relevant final output file(s) to the intended output
directory.  Emulation can be turned on by setting the configuration
variable \fI$emulate_aux\fR to one in a configuration file or by using
latexmk's \fB-emulate-aux-dir\fR option.  The emulation method works
equally well if MiKTeX is used.

Latexmk also turns emulation on if it is found to be needed, as follows.
Suppose emulation is initially off, but the aux and output directories are
different.  Then latexmk invokes *latex with an -aux-directory option and
after the run finds that it hasn't been obeyed, notably because the .log
file is in the output directory rather than the aux directory.  Latexmk
then sets emulation on, and retries.  Conceivably, it could move all the
appropriate generated files from the output directory to the aux directory;
but there is such a large variety of possibilities for these files that
this is hard to identify all of them reliably except for simple cases. 

Note that the emulation issue only arises when the user has arranged for
the the aux and output directories to be different.  When instead they are
equal, e.g., because the user only set the \fI$out_dir\fR variable, then
latexmk invokes *latex with only an \fB-output-directory\fR option, which
works as intended with both TeXLive and MiKTeX.

In addition, latexmk arranges the invocations of any auxiliary programs
like bibtex and makeindex so that they will read and write the relevant
files from and to the aux directory.  Programs like dvips, dvipdf, ps2pdf,
and xdvipdfmx are invoked so that they read from the appropriate places and
write their output to the output directory.

\fIFiles considered as final output files, i.e., those that belong in the
output directory rather than the aux directory\fR: These have the
extensions .dvi, .ps., .pdf, .synctex, and .synctex.gz.
A special case, because of compatibility issues, is of .fls files: See
below.

Note that xelatex when invoked with its \fB-no-pdf\fR option, as latexmk
does, generates an .xdv file, which would appear to have the same status as
a .dvi file generated by latex.  Nevertheless, latexmk treats .xdv as an
intermediate file that is found in the aux directory.  This is to match
MiKTeX's treatment of the \fB-aux-directory\fR option.  As further
justification, one can say that under modern conditions an .xdv file is
(almost) always an intermediate file.  Historically, the situation
with .dvi files from latex was different, and currently dvi previewers do
exist.


\fIVariables and options for directories\fR: The variables for setting the
aux and output directories are \fI$aux_dir\fR and \fI$out_dir\fR, with
corresponding command line options \fB-auxdir\fR (or \fB-aux-directory\fR)
and \fB-outdir\fR (or \fB-output-directory\fR).  When a value for these is
blank (which is the default value), it implies the use of a default: For
the aux directory, the default is to set it equal to the output directory.
For the output directory, the default is to be the current directory.

For the turning on and off of the emulation mode, there is the
configuration variable \fI$emulate_aux\fR and the options
\fB-emulate-aux-dir\fR, \fB-emulate-aux-dir-\fR, \fB-noemulate-aux-dir\fR.


\fIInteraction with -cd option\fR: When the \fB-cd\fR option is used (or
the equivalent setting of \fI$do_cd\fR variable), then latexmk changes the
working directory to the document directory before invoking *latex.  If the
aux and/or output directories are given by relative paths, e.g., by
\fB-outdir=output\fR for a directory named "output", then the directories
are relative to the document directory, rather than relative to the working
directory that was in effect when latexmk was invoked. This matches the
behavior of *latex as invoked with the provided command line directory
argument(s) after the change of working directory to the document
directory.

\fIAutomatic creation of aux and output directories\fR: Unlike *latex, if
latexmk finds the requested directory/ies don't exist, it creates it/them,
thereby avoiding errors when *latex is invoked.

If the document uses the \\include macro to read a .tex file from a
subdirectory, *latex will attempt to write an extra aux file to the
corresponding subdirectory of the aux directory.  If the subdirectory
doesn't exist, then *latex will complain that it can't write the aux file.
After the run of *latex, latexmk detects this situation, creates the
necessary directory, and reruns *latex with the error situation corrected.

\fIChoice of aux and output directories\fR: Often the aux
and output directories are given as subdirectories of the document
directory, e.g., by \fB-outdir=output\fR. But it is possible to provide,
for example, an absolute path or a path relative to a parent directory,
e.g., "/tmp/foo" or "../output".  Be aware that in general this can cause
problems, notably with \fImakeindex\fR or \fIbibtex\fR.  This is because
modern versions of these programs, by default, will refuse to work when
they find that they are asked to write to a file in a directory that
appears not to be the current working directory or one of its
subdirectories.  This is part of security measures by the whole TeX system
that try to prevent malicious or errant TeX documents from incorrectly
messing with a user's files.

By default, latexmk evades this issue: Before running bibtex and makeindex,
latexmk changes working directory to the aux directory, with appropriate
settings of search paths.  The use or non-use of this trick is governed by
the variables \fI$bibtex_fudge\fR and \fI$makeindex_fudge\fR.
Unfortunately, the trick sometimes makes bibtex and makeindex unable to
find files.

If necessary the trick can be turned off. But this is incompatible with an
aux directory like, "/tmp/foo" of "../output").  If you really have to deal
with this situation, and only if you have to deal with it, then you need to
disable the security measures (and assume any risks).  One way of doing
this is to temporarily set an operating system environment variable
openout_any to "a" (as in "all"), to override the default "paranoid"
setting.

\fICertain names of aux and output directories not allowed on Microsoft
Windows\fR: It is natural to want to use the name "aux" for the aux
directory, e.g., by using the option \fB-auxdir=aux\fR.  But on Microsoft
operating systems "aux" is one of the names that is not allowed for a file
or directory.  I find it useful to standardize on a name like "auxdir"
(e.g., by \fB-auxdir=auxdir\fR); this works independently of operating
system.

\fILocation of .fls file\fR: Much of the dependency information that
latexmk uses comes from the .fls file generated when *latex is invoked with
the \fB-recorder\fR option, which latexmk does by default.  It may seem
rational that this is written to the aux directory.  But in fact versions
of MiKTeX prior to Oct. 2020 wrote it to the output directory.  Later
versions do write it to the aux directory.  To deal with this, latexmk does
two things: First, if latexmk finds that the .fls file has only been
generated in the "wrong" directory, then latexmk copies it to the expected
directory, after which latexmk's operation continues correctly
independently of the behavior of *latex. Second it allows its idea of the
"correct" (or expected) directory to be configured by the variable
\fI$fls_uses_aux_dir\fR.  This defaults to zero, to correspond to MiKTeX's
current behavior.


.SH ALLOWING FOR CHANGE OF OUTPUT FILE TYPE

When one of the latex engines is run, the usual situation is that
\fIlatex\fR produces a .dvi file, while \fIpdflatex\fR and
\fIlualatex\fR produce a .pdf file.  For \fIxelatex\fR the default is
to produce a .pdf file, but to optimize processing time \fIlatexmk\fR
runs \fIxelatex\fR its \fB-no-pdf\fR option so that it produces
an .xdv file.  Further processing by \fIlatexmk\fR takes this as a
starting point.

However, the actual output file may differ from the normal
expectation; and then \fIlatexmk\fR can adjust its processing to
accommodate this situation.  The difference in output file type can
happen for two reasons: One is that for \fIlatex\fR, \fIpdflatex\fR
and \fIlualatex\fR the document itself can override the defaults. The
other is that there may be a configuration, or misconfiguration, such
that the program that \fIlatexmk\fR invokes to compile the document is
not the expected one, or is given options incompatible with what
\fIlatexmk\fR initially expects.

Under \fIlatex\fR and \fIpdflatex\fR, control of the output format by
the document is done by setting the \\pdfoutput macro.  Under
\fIlualatex\fR, the \\outputmode macro is used instead.

One example of an important use-case for document control of the
output format is a document that uses the psfrag package to insert
graphical elements in the output file. The psfrag package achieves its
effects by inserting postscript code in the output of the compilation
of the document.  This entails the use of compilation to a .dvi file,
followed by the use of conversion to a postscript file (either
directly, as by \fIdvips\fR or implicitly, as an intermediate step by
\fIdvipdf\fR).  Then it is useful to force output to be of the .dvi
format by inserting \\pdfoutput=0 in the preamble of the document.

Another example is where the document uses graphics file of
the .pdf, .jpg, and png types.  With the default setting for the
graphicx package, these can be processed in compilation to .pdf but
not with compilation to .dvi.  In this case, it is useful to insert
\\pdfoutput=1 in the preamble of the document to force compilation
to .pdf output format.

In all of these cases, it is needed that \fIlatexmk\fR has to adjust
its processing to deal with a mismatch between the actual output
format (out of .pdf, .dvi, .xdv) and the initially expected output, if
possible.  \fILatexmk\fR does this provided the following conditions
are met.

The first is that \fIlatexmk\fR's \fI$allow_switch\fR configuration
variable is set to a non-zero value as it is by default.  If this
variable is zero, a mismatch of filetypes in the compilation results
in an error.

The second condition for \fIlatexmk\fR to be able to handle a change
of output type is that no explicit requests for .dvi or .ps output
files are made.  Explicit requests are by the \fB-dvi\fR and
\fB-ps\fR, \fB-print=dvi\fR, \fB-print=ps\fR, \fB-view=dvi\fR, and
\fB-view=ps\fR options, and by corresponding settings of the
\fI$dvi_mode\fR, \fI$postscript_mode\fR, \fI$print_type\fR, and
\fI$view\fR configuration variables.  The print-type and view-type
restrictions only apply when printing and viewing are explicitly
requested, respectively.  For this purpose, the use of the
\fB-pdfdvi\fR and \fB-pdfps\fR options (and the corresponding setting
of the \fI$pdf_mode\fR variable) does not count as an explicit request
for the .dvi and .ps files; they are merely regarded as a request for
making a .pdf file together with an initial proposal for the
processing route to make it.

Note that when accommodating a change in output file type, there is
involved a substantial change in the network of rules that
\fIlatexmk\fR uses in its actions.  The second condition applied to
accommodate a change is to avoid situations where the change in the
rule network is too radical to be readily handled automatically.


.SH CONFIGURATION/INITIALIZATION (RC) FILES
.PP
In this section is explained which configuration files are read by
\fIlatexmk\fR. Subsequent sections "How to Set Variables in
Initialization Files", "Format of Command Specifications", "List of
Configuration Variables Usable in Initialization Files", "Custom
Dependencies", and "Advanced Configuration" give details on what can
be configured and how.

\fILatexmk\fR can be customized using initialization files, which are
read at startup in the following order:
.PP
1) The system RC file, if it exists.  
   On a UNIX system, \fIlatexmk\fR searches the following directories for a
   system RC file, which may be named either "LatexMk" or "latexmkrc".  The
   directories are searched in the following order, and \fIlatexmk\fR uses
   the first such file it finds (if any):
   "/etc",
   "/opt/local/share/latexmk",
   "/usr/local/share/latexmk",
   "/usr/local/lib/latexmk".
   On a MS-Windows system it looks just in "C:\\latexmk".
   On a cygwin system (i.e., a MS-Windows system in which Perl is
that of cygwin), \fIlatexmk\fR looks in the directories
   "/cygdrive/c/latexmk",
   "/etc",
   "/opt/local/share/latexmk",
   "/usr/local/share/latexmk",
   "/usr/local/lib/latexmk".

If the environment variable LATEXMKRCSYS is set, its value is used as
the name of the system RC file, instead of any of the above.
.PP
2) The user's RC file, if it exists.  This can be in one of two
places.  The traditional one is ".latexmkrc" in the user's home
directory.  The other possibility is "latexmk/latexmkrc" in the user's
XDG configuration home directory.  The actual file read is the first
of "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/latexmk/latexmkrc" or "$HOME/.latexmkrc" which
exists.  (See
https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html
for details on the XDG Base Directory Specification.)

Here $HOME
is the user's home directory.  [\fILatexmk\fR determines the user's
home directory as follows:  It is the value of the environment variable
HOME, if this variable exists, which normally is the case on UNIX-like
systems (including Linux and OS-X).  Otherwise the environment
variable USERPROFILE is used, if it exists, which normally is the case
on MS-Windows systems. Otherwise a blank string is used instead of
$HOME, in which case \fIlatexmk\fR does not look for an RC file in
it.]

$XDG_CONFIG_HOME is the value of the environment variable
XDG_CONFIG_HOME if it exists.  If this environment variable does not
exist, but $HOME is non-blank, then $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set to the
default value of $HOME/.config.  Otherwise $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is blank,
and \fIlatexmk\fR does not look for an RC file under it.

.PP
3) The RC file in the current working directory.  This file can be
named either "latexmkrc" or ".latexmkrc", and the first of these to be
found is used, if any.
.PP
4) Any RC file(s) specified on the command line with the \fB-r\fR
option.
.PP
Each RC file is a sequence of \fIPerl\fR commands.  Naturally, a user can use
this in creative ways.  But for most purposes, one simply uses a
sequence of assignment statements that override some of the built-in
settings of \fILatexmk\fR.  Straightforward cases can be handled
without knowledge of the \fIPerl\fR language by using the examples in this
document as templates.  Comment lines are introduced by the "#"
character.

Note that command line options are obeyed in the order in which
they are written; thus any RC file specified on the command line with
the \fB-r\fR option can override previous options but can be itself
overridden by later options on the command line.  There is also the
\fB-e\fR option, which allows initialization code to be specified in
\fIlatexmk\fR's command line.

\fI

example_rcfiles in the distribution of \fIlatexmk\fR (e.g., at

.SH HOW TO SET VARIABLES IN INITIALIZATION FILES
.PP
The important variables that can be configured are described in the
section "List of configuration variables usable in initialization
files".  (See the earlier section "Configuration/Initialization (rc)
Files" for the files where the configurations are done.)  Syntax for
setting these variables is of the following forms:
.PP
	$bibtex = 'bibtex %O %S';
.PP
for the setting of a string variable, 
.PP
	$preview_mode = 1;
.PP
for the setting of a numeric variable, and
.PP
	@default_files = ('paper', 'paper1');
.PP
for the setting of an array of strings.  It is possible to append an
item to an array variable as follows:

	push @default_files, 'paper2';

Note that simple "scalar" variables have names that begin with a $
character and array variables have names that begin with a @
character. Each statement ends with a semicolon.

Strings should be enclosed in single quotes.  (You could use double
quotes, as in many programming languages.  But then the \fIPerl\fR
programming language brings into play some special rules for
interpolating variables into strings.  People not fluent in \fIPerl\fR
will want to avoid these complications.)

You can do much more complicated things, but for this you will need to
consult a manual for the \fIPerl\fR programming language.  



.SH FORMAT OF COMMAND SPECIFICATIONS

Some of the variables set the commands that \fIlatexmk\fR uses for
carrying out its work, for example to generate a .dvi file from a .tex
file or to view a postscript file.  This section describes some
important features of how the commands are specified.
(Note\ that some of the possibilities listed here do not apply to
the \fI$kpsewhich\fR variable; see its documentation.)

\fBPlaceholders\fR:  Supposed you wanted \fIlatexmk\fR to use the
command elatex in place of the regular latex command, and suppose
moreover that you wanted to give it the option "--shell-escape".  You
could do this by the following setting:
.PP
     $latex = 'elatex --shell-escape %O %S';
.PP
The two items starting with the % character are placeholders.  These
are substituted by appropriate values before the command is run.  Thus
%S will be replaced by the source file that elatex will be applied to,
and %O will be replaced by any options that \fIlatexmk\fR has decided
to use for this command.  (E.g., if you used the \fB-silent\fR option in the
invocation of \fIlatexmk\fR,  it results in the replacement of %O by
"-interaction=batchmode".) 

The available placeholders are:
.TP
.B %A
basename of the main tex file.  Unlike %R, this is unaffected by the
setting of a jobname by  the \fI-jobname\fR option or the
\fI$jobname\fR configuration value.
.TP
.B %B
base of filename for current command.  E.g., if a postscript file
document.ps is being made from the dvi file document.dvi, then the
basename is document.
.TP
.B %D
destination file (e.g., the name of the postscript file when
converting a dvi file to postscript).
.TP
.B %O
options
.TP
.B %P
If the variable \fI$pre_tex_code\fR is non-empty, then %P is
substituted by the contents of \fI$pre_tex_code\fR followed by
\fI\\input{SOURCE}\fR, where SOURCE stands for the name of the source
file.  Appropriate quoting is done.  This enables TeX code to be
passed to one of the \fI*latex\fR engines to be executed before the
source file is read.

If the variable \fI$pre_tex_code\fR is the empty string, then %P is
equivalent to %S.
.TP
.B %R
root filename.

By default this is the basename of the main tex file.  However the
value can be changed by the use of the \fI-jobname\fR option or the
\fI$jobname\fR configuration variable.  This is then the basename for files
like the .aux and .log files produced by running *latex, as well for the
main .dvi, .pdf, .ps and/or .xdvi files.
.TP
.B %S
source file (e.g., the name of the dvi file when converting a .dvi file
to ps).
.TP
.B %T
The name of the primary tex file.
.TP
.B %U
If the variable \fI$pre_tex_code\fR is non-empty, then its value is
substituted for %U (appropriately quoted).  Otherwise it is replaced
by a null string.
.TP
.B %Y
Name of directory for auxiliary output files (see the configuration
variable \fI$aux_dir\fR).  A directory separation character ('/') is
appended if \fI$aux_dir\fR is non-empty and does not end in a suitable
character, with suitable characters being those appropriate to UNIX
and MS-Windows, i.e., ':', '/' and '\\'.   Note that if after
initialization,  \fI$out_dir\fR is set, but \fI$aux_dir\fR is not set
(i.e., it is blank), then \fIlatexmk\fR sets \fI$aux_dir\fR to the
same value \fI$out_dir\fR.
.TP
.B %Z
Name of directory for output files (see the configuration
variable \fI$out_dir\fR).  A directory separation character ('/') is
appended if \fI$out_dir\fR is non-empty and does not end in a suitable
character, with suitable characters being those appropriate to UNIX
and MS-Windows, i.e., ':', '/' and '\\'. 
.PP
If for some reason you need a literal % character in your string not
subject to the above rules, use "%%".
.PP
Appropriate quoting will be applied to the filename substitutions, so
you mustn't supply them yourself even if the names of your files have
spaces in them.  (But if your TeX filenames have spaces in them,
beware that some older versions of the TeX program cannot correctly handle
filenames containing spaces.)  In case \fIlatexmk\fR's quoting does not work
correctly on your system, you can turn it off -- see the documentation
for the variable \fI$quote_filenames\fR.
.PP

See the default values in the section "List of configuration variables
usable in initialization files" for what is normally the most
appropriate usage. 

If you omit to supply any placeholders whatever in the specification
of a command, \fIlatexmk\fR will supply what its author thinks are
appropriate defaults.  This gives compatibility with configuration
files for previous versions of \fIlatexmk\fR, which didn't use
placeholders.

\fB"Detaching" a command\fR: Normally when \fIlatexmk\fR runs a
command, it waits for the command to run to completion.  This is
appropriate for commands like latex, of course.  But for previewers,
the command should normally run detached, so that \fIlatexmk\fR gets
the previewer running and then returns to its next task (or exits if
there is nothing else to do).  To achieve this effect of detaching a
command, you need to precede the command name with "start ", as in
.PP
     $dvi_previewer = 'start xdvi %O %S';
.PP
This will be translated to whatever is appropriate for your operating
system.

Notes: (1) In some circumstances, \fIlatexmk\fR will always run a
command detached.  This is the case for a previewer in preview
continuous mode, since otherwise previewing continuously makes no
sense.  (2) This precludes the possibility of running a command named
start.  (3) If the word start occurs more than once at the beginning
of the command string, that is equivalent to having just one.  (4)
Under cygwin, some complications happen, since cygwin amounts to a
complicated merging of UNIX and MS-Windows.  See the source code for
how I've handled the problem.

\fBCommand names containing spaces\fR: Under MS-Windows it is common
that the name of a command includes spaces, since software is often
installed in a subdirectory of "C:\\Program Files".  Such command names
should be enclosed in double quotes, as in
.PP
     $lpr_pdf = '"c:/Program Files/Ghostgum/gsview/gsview32.exe" /p %S';
     $pdf_previewer = 'start "c:/Program Files/SumatraPDF/SumatraPDF.exe" %O %S';
     $pdf_previewer = 'start "c:/Program Files/SumatraPDF (x86)/SumatraPDF.exe" %O %S';

.PP
(Note about the above example: Under MS-Windows forward slashes are
equivalent to backslashes in a filename under almost all circumstances,
provided that the filename 
is inside double quotes.  It is easier to use forward slashes in
examples like the one above, since then one does not have to worry
about the rules for dealing with forward slashes in strings in the
Perl language.)

\fBCommand names under Cygwin\fR: If \fIlatexmk\fR is executed by Cygwin's
Perl, \fI be particularly certain that pathnames in commands have
\fBforward\fI slashes\fR not the usual backslashes for the separator
of pathname components.  See the above examples.  Backslashes often
get misinterpreted by the Unix shell used by Cygwin's Perl to execute
external commands.  Forward slashes don't suffer from this problem,
and (when quoted, as above) are equally acceptable to MS-Windows.

\fBUsing MS-Windows file associations\fR: A useful trick under modern
versions of MS-Windows (e.g., WinXP) is to use just the 
command 'start' by itself:
.PP
     $dvi_previewer = 'start %S';
.PP
Under MS-Windows, this will cause to be run
whatever program the system has associated with dvi files.  (The same
applies for a postscript viewer and a pdf viewer.)  But note that this
trick is not always suitable for the pdf previwer, if your system has
acroread for the default pdf viewer.  As explained elsewhere, acroread
under MS-Windows does not work well with \fIlatex\fR and
\fIlatexmk\fR, because acroread locks the pdf file.

\fBNot using a certain command\fR: If a command is not to be run, the
command name NONE is used, as in
.PP
     $lpr  = 'NONE lpr';
.PP
This typically is used when an appropriate command does not exist on
your system.  The string after the "NONE" is effectively a comment.

\fBOptions to commands\fR:
Setting the name of a command can be used not only for changing the
name of the command called, but also to add options to command.
Suppose you want \fIlatexmk\fR to use latex with source specials
enabled.  Then you might use the following line in an initialization
file:
.PP
     $latex = 'latex --src-specials %O %S';
.PP

\fBRunning a subroutine instead of an external command\fR: Use a
specification starting with "internal", as in 
.PP
     $latex = 'internal mylatex %O %S';
     sub mylatex {
         my @args = @_;
         # Possible preprocessing here
         return system 'latex', @args;
     }
.PP
For some of the more exotic possibilities that then become available,
see the section "Advanced configuration: Some extra resources and
advanced tricks". Also see some of the examples in the directory
\fIexample_rcfiles\fR in the \fIlatexmk\fR distribution.

\fBAdvanced tricks\fR: Normally one specifies a single command for the
commands invoked by \fIlatexmk\fR.  Naturally, if there is some
complicated additional processing you need to do in your special
situation, you can write a script (or batch file) to do the
processing, and then configure \fIlatexmk\fR to use your script in
place of the standard program.

You can also use a Perl subroutine instead of a script -- see above.
This is generally the most flexible and portable solution.

It is also possible to configure \fIlatexmk\fR to run multiple
commands.  For example, if when running \fIpdflatex\fR to generate a pdf
file from a tex file you need to run another program after \fIpdflatex\fR to
perform some extra processing, you could do something like:

     $pdflatex = 'pdflatex --shell-escape %O %S; pst2pdf_for_latexmk %B';

This definition assumes you are using a UNIX-like system (which
includes Linux and OS-X), so that the
two commands to be run are separated by the semicolon in the middle of
the string.

If you are using MS-Windows, you would replace the above line by 

   $pdflatex = 'cmd /c pdflatex --shell-escape %O %S'
               . '&& pst2pdf_for_latexmk %B';

Here, the UNIX command separator ; is replaced by &&.  In addition,
there is a problem that some versions of \fIPerl\fR on MS-Windows do
not obey the command separator; this problem is overcome by explicitly
invoking the MS-Windows command-line processor \fIcmd.exe\fR.

.SH LIST OF CONFIGURATION VARIABLES USABLE IN INITIALIZATION FILES
.PP
In this section are specified the variables whose values can be
adjusted to configure \fIlatexmk\fR.  (See the earlier section
"Configuration/Initialization (rc) Files" for the files where the
configurations are done.)

Default values are indicated in brackets.  Note that for variables
that are boolean in character, concerning whether \fIlatexmk\fR does
or does not behave in a certain way, a non-zero value, normally 1,
indicates true, i.e., the behavior occurs, while a zero value
indicates a false value, i.e., the behavior does not occur.

.TP
.B $allow_subdir_creation [1]

Specify action to take when message(s) in the .log file indicate a failure
of an attempt by a *latex compilation to write a file to a subdirectory of
the output directory because the subdirectory didn't exist.

If the value if \fI$allow_subdir_creation\fR is 0, no action is taken.  If
it is 1, then the appropriate subdirectory is created and a rerun of *latex
is triggered, but only if the file being written is an .aux file.  (This
happens, for example, if the document includes a file from a subdirectory
of the document directory, by the \\include command.  If the value of
\fI$allow_subdir_creation\fR is 2, then the subdirectory creation is done
independently of which type of file is in question.

.TP
.B $allow_switch [1]

This controls what happens when the output extension of latex,
pdflatex, lualatex or xelatex differs from what is expected.  (The
possible extensions are .dvi, .pdf, .xdv.)  This can happen with the
use of the \\pdfoutput macro in a document compiled under \fIlatex\fR
or \fIpdflatex\fR, or with the use of the \\outputmode macro under
\fIlualatex\fR.  It can also happen with certain kinds of incorrect
configuration. 

In such a case, \fIlatexmk\fR can appropriately adjust its network of
rules.  The adjustment is made if \fI$allow_switch\fR is on, and if no
request for a dvi or ps file has been made.

See the section ALLOWING FOR CHANGE OF OUTPUT EXTENSION.

.TP
.B $always_view_file_via_temporary [0]
Whether .ps and .pdf files are initially to be made in a temporary
directory and then moved to the final location.  (This applies to
\fIdvips\fR, \fIdvipdf\fR, and \fIps2pdf\fR operations, and the
filtering operators on .dvi and .ps files.  It does not apply to
\fIpdflatex\fR, unfortunately, since \fIpdflatex\fR provides no way of
specifying a chosen name for the output file.)

This use of a temporary file solves a problem that the making of these
files can occupy a substantial time.  If a viewer (notably \fIgv\fR)
sees that the file has changed, it may read the new file before
the program writing the file has not yet finished its work, which  can
cause havoc.

See the \fI$pvc_view_file_via_temporary\fR variable for a setting that
applies only if preview-continuous mode (-pvc option) is used.  See
\fI$tmpdir\fR for the setting of the directory where the temporary
file is created. 

.TP
.B $analyze_input_log_always [1]

After a run of latex (etc), always analyze .log for input files in the
<...> and (...) constructions.  Otherwise, only do the analysis when
fls file doesn't exist or is out of date.

Under normal circumstances, the data in the fls file is reliable, and
the test of the log file gets lots of false positives; usually
$analyze_input_log_always is best set to zero.  But the test of the
log file is needed at least in the following situation: When a user
needs to persuade latexmk that a certain file is a source file, and
latexmk doesn't otherwise find it.  Then the user can write code that
causes a line with (...) to be written to log file.  One important
case is for lualatex, which doesn't always generate lines in the .fls
file for input lua files.  (The situation with lualatex is HIGHLY
version dependent, e.g., there was a big change between TeXLive 2016
and TeXLive 2017.)

To keep backward compatibility with older versions
of latexmk, the default is to set
$analyze_input_log_always to 1.

.TP
.B $auto_rc_use [1]
Whether to automatically read the standard initialization (rc) files,
which are the system RC file, the user's RC file, and the RC file in
the current directory.  The command line option \fB-norc\fR can be
used to turn this setting off.  Each RC file could also turn this
setting off, i.e., it could set \fI$auto_rc_use\fR to zero to prevent
automatic reading of the later RC files.

This variable does not affect the reading of RC files specified on the
command line by the \fB-r\fR option.
.TP
.B $aux_dir [""]
The aux directory, i.e., the directory in which auxiliary files (aux, log,
etc) are to be written by a run of *latex.

If this variable is not set, but \fI$out_dir\fR is set, then latexmk takes
the aux directory to equal the output directory which is the directory to
which final output files are to be written.

If neither variable is set, then the current directory when *latex is
invoked is used both for the aux and output directories.

If the aux and output directories are distinct, then the aux directory
contains all generated files with the exception of "final output files",
which are defined to be .dvi, .ps, .pdf, .synctex, and .synctex.gz files.

See the section AUXILIARY AND OUTPUT DIRECTORIES for more details.


.TP
.B $aux_out_dir_report [0]
If this variable is set to 1, then prior to the processing of each
primary .tex file, list the settings for aux and output directories, after
they have been normalized from the settings specified during
initialization.

This report gives a reminder of where to look for generated files.

The report is done per primary .tex file, because of possible directory
changes for each file (when the \fB-cd\fR option is used).  In the simplest
cases, the directory names are the same as originally specified.  But in
general some clean up/normalization is performed; this helps performance
and cleans up output to the screen.

If this variable is set to 2, then halt after reporting the settings for
the aux and out directories, rather than continuing with processing of tex
files.  This setting is primarily used for debugging configuration issues.
See the \fB-dir-report-only\fR option.

.TP
.B $bad_warning_is_error [0]
Whether to treat bad warnings reported by *latex in log file as errors. The
specifications of the warning messages are in \fI@bad_warnings\fR.

.TP
.B @bad_warnings
Array of regular expressions specifying messages in log file that are
officially treated as warnings rather than errors by *latex, but which a
user may treat as errors: See \fI$bad_warning_is_error\fR.

Currently the default set of these warnings is those about \\end occurring
inside constructs.

.TP
.B $banner [0]
If nonzero, the banner message is printed across each page when
converting the dvi file to postscript.  Without modifying the variable
\fI$banner_message\fR, this is equivalent to specifying the \fB-d\fR
option.

Note that if \fI$banner\fR is nonzero, the \fI$postscript_mode\fR is
assumed and the postscript file is always generated, even if it is newer
than the dvi file.
.TP
.B $banner_intensity [0.95]
Equivalent to the \fB-bi\fR option, this is a decimal number between 0
and 1 that specifies how dark to print the banner message. 0 is black,
1 is white.  The default is just right if your toner cartridge isn't
running too low.
.TP
.B $banner_message ["DRAFT"]
The banner message to print across each page when converting the dvi
file to postscript.  This is equivalent to the \fB-bm\fR option.
.TP
.B $banner_scale [220.0]
A decimal number that specifies how large the banner message will be
printed.  Experimentation is necessary to get the right scale for your
message, as a rule of thumb the scale should be about equal to 1100
divided by the number of characters in the message.  The Default is
just right for 5 character messages.  This is equivalent to the
\fB-bs\fR option.
.TP
.B @BIBINPUTS
This is an array variable, now mostly obsolete, that specifies
directories where 
\fIlatexmk\fR should look for .bib files.  By default it is set from
the BIBINPUTS environment variable of the operating system.  If that
environment variable is not set, a single element list consisting of
the current directory is set.  The format of the directory names
depends on your operating system, of course.  Examples for setting
this variable are:

        @BIBINPUTS = ( ".", "C:\\\\bibfiles" );
        @BIBINPUTS = ( ".", "\\\\server\\bibfiles" );
        @BIBINPUTS = ( ".", "C:/bibfiles" );
        @BIBINPUTS = ( ".", "//server/bibfiles" );
        @BIBINPUTS = ( ".", "/usr/local/texmf/bibtex/bib" );

Note that under MS Windows, either a forward slash "/" or a backward slash
"\(rs" can be used to separate pathname components, so the first two and
the second two examples are equivalent.  Each backward slash should be
doubled to avoid running afoul of \fIPerl\fR's rules for writing
strings. Generally, it is simplest always to use forward slashes instead of
backward slashes.

\fIImportant note:\fR This variable is now mostly obsolete in the current
version of \fIlatexmk\fR, since it now uses a better method of searching
for files using the kpsewhich command.  However, if your system is an
unusual one without the kpsewhich command, you may need to set the variable
\fI@BIBINPUTS\fR.

.TP
.B $biber ["biber %O %S"]
The biber processing program.

.TP
.B $biber_silent_switch ["--onlylog"]
Switch(es) for the biber processing program when silent mode is on.
.TP
.B $bibtex ["bibtex %O %S"]
The BibTeX processing program.
.TP
.B $bibtex_fudge [1]
When using bibtex, whether to change directory to $aux_dir before running
bibtex.

The need arises as follows:

a. With bibtex before about 2019, if the filename given to it contains a
path component, there was a bug that bibtex would not find extra aux files,
as produced by the \\include command in TeX.

b. With all moderately recent versions of bibtex, bibtex may refuse to
write its bbl and blg files, for security reasons, for certain cases of the
path component of the filename given to it.

However, there are also rare cases where the change-directory method
prevents bibtex from finding certain bib or bst files. Then
\fI$bibtex_fudge\fR needs to be set to 0.

.TP
.B $bibtex_silent_switch ["-terse"]
Switch(es) for the BibTeX processing program when silent mode is on.

.TP
.B $bibtex_use [1]
Under what conditions to run \fIbibtex\fR or \fIbiber\fR.  When
\fIlatexmk\fR discovers
from the log file that one (or more)
\fIbibtex\fR/\fIbiber\fR-generated bibliographies 
are used, it can run \fIbibtex\fR or \fIbiber\fR whenever it appears
necessary to regenerate the bbl file(s) from their source bib database
file(s).
But sometimes, the bib file(s) are not available (e.g., for a document
obtained from an external archive), but the bbl files are provided.
In that case use of \fIbibtex\fR or \fIbiber\fR will result in
incorrect overwriting of the precious bbl files.  The variable
\fI$bibtex_use\fR controls whether this happens, and also controls
whether or not .bbl files are deleted in a cleanup operation.

The possible values of \fI$bibtex_use\fR are:
  0: never use \fIbibtex\fR or \fIbiber\fR; never delete .bbl files in a cleanup.
  1: only use \fIbibtex\fR or \fIbiber\fR if the bib file(s) exist; never
  delete .bbl files in a cleanup.  
  1.5: only use \fIbibtex\fR or \fIbiber\fR if the bib files exist;
  conditionally delete .bbl files in a cleanup (i.e., delete them only when
  the bib files all exist).  
  2: run \fIbibtex\fR or \fIbiber\fR whenever it appears necessary to
update the bbl file(s), without testing for the existence of the bib 
files; always delete .bbl files in a cleanup.

\fINote\fR: When \fIbiber\fR is being used, conditional use of \fIbiber\fR
can be problematic.  From \fIlatexmk\fR's point of view the problem is that
because of how \fIbiber\fR works, a full knowledge of its source files can
only be obtained after running \fIbiber\fR.  In contrast, for \fIbibtex\fR,
full information on which bib files are used is obtained from the .aux
file(s) after a run of *latex.  But for \fIbiber\fR, the corresponding
information is somewhat incomplete; this the information obtained in
the .bcf file that is generated by the biblatex package during a run of
*latex.

.TP
.B $cleanup_includes_cusdep_generated [0]
If nonzero, specifies that cleanup also deletes files that are
generated by custom dependencies.
(When doing a clean up, e.g., by use of the \fB-C\fR option, custom
dependencies are those listed in the \fI.fdb_latexmk\fR file from a
previous run.)

.TP
.B $cleanup_includes_generated [0]
If nonzero, specifies that cleanup also deletes files that are
detected in the fls file (or failing that, in log file) as being
generated.  It will also include files made from these first
generation generated files.

This operation is somewhat dangerous, and can have unintended
consequences, since the files to be deleted are determined from a file
created by *latex, which can contain erroneous
information. Therefore this variable is turned off by default, and
then files to be deleted are restricted to those explicitly specified
by patterns configured in the variables \fIclean_ext\fR,
\fIclean_full_ext\fR, and \fI@generated_exts\fR.  Standard cases (e.g., .log
files) appear in \fIlatexmk\fR's initial value for the array
\fI@generated_exts\fR. 
.TP
.B $cleanup_mode [0]
If nonzero, specifies cleanup mode: 1 for full cleanup, 2 for cleanup
except for .dvi, .ps and .pdf files, 3 for cleanup except for dep and aux
files.  (There is also extra cleaning as specified by the
\fI$clean_ext\fR, \fI$clean_full_ext\fR and \fI@generated_exts\fR
variables.)

This variable is equivalent to specifying one of
the \fB-c\fR or \fB-C\fR options.  But there should be no need
to set this variable from an RC file.
.TP
.B $clean_ext [""]
Extra extensions of files for \fIlatexmk\fR to remove when any of the
clean-up options (\fB-c\fR or \fB-C\fR) is selected.
The value of this variable is a string containing the extensions
separated by spaces.

It is also possible to specify a more general pattern of file to be
deleted, by using the place holder %R, as in commands, and it is also
possible to use wildcards.  Thus setting

    $clean_ext = "out %R-blx.bib %R-figures*.log pythontex-files-%R/*";

in an initialization file will imply that when a clean-up operation is
specified, not only is the standard set of files deleted, but also
files of the form FOO.out, FOO-blx.bib, FOO-figures*.log, and
pythontex-files-FOO/*, where FOO stands for the basename of the file
being processed (as in FOO.tex).

Most of the files to be deleted are relative to the directory specified by
\fI$aux_dir\fR.  Note that if \fI$out_dir\fR but not \fI$aux_dir\fR is
set, then in its initialization, \fIlatexmk\fR sets \fI$aux_dir\fR equal to
\fI$out_dir\fR.  A normal situation is therefore that \fI$aux_dir\fR equals
\fI$out_dir\fR, which is the only case directly supported by TeXLive,
unlike MiKTeX.  Note that even with TeXLive latexmk does now support
different values for the directories -- see the explanation of the
\fI$emulate_aux\fR variable.

If \fI$out_dir\fR and \fI$aux_dir\fR different, latexmk actually deletes
any files of the specified names in both \fI$aux_dir\fR and \fI$out_dir\fR;
this is because under certain error conditions, the files may be put in
\fI$out_dir\fR instead of \fI$aux_dir\fR.  This also handles the case of
deleting any fls file, since that file is in \fI$out_dir\fR.

The filenames specified for a clean-up operation can refer not only to
regular files but also to directories.  Directories are only deleted
if they are empty.  An example of an application is to pythontex, which
creates files in a particular directory.  You can arrange to remove
both the files and the directory by setting

    $clean_ext = "pythontex-files-%R/* pythontex-files-%R";

See also the (array) variable \fI@generated_exts\fR.  In the past, this
variable had certain uses beyond that of \fI$clean_ext\fR.  But now, they
accomplish the same things.  In fact, after initialization including the
processing of command line options, \fIlatexmk\fR simply appends the list
of extensions in \fI$clean_ext\fR to the array \fI@generated_exts\fR.
.TP
.B $clean_full_ext [""]
Extra extensions of files for \fIlatexmk\fR to remove when the \fB-C\fR
option is selected, i.e., extensions of files to remove when the .dvi,
etc files are to be cleaned-up.

More general patterns are allowed, as for \fI$clean_ext\fR.

The files specified by \fI$clean_full_ext\fR to be deleted are
relative to the directory specified by \fI$out_dir\fR.

.TP
.B $compiling_cmd [""], $failure_cmd [""], $warning_cmd [""], $success_cmd [""]

These variables specify commands that are executed at certain points
of compilations.  One motivation for
their existence is to allow very useful convenient visual indications of
compilation status even when the window receiving the screen output of
the compilation is hidden.  This is particularly useful in
preview-continuous mode.

The commands are executed at the following points:
\fI$compiling_cmd\fR at the start of compilation, \fI$success_cmd\fR
at the end of a completely successful compilation, \fI$failure_cmd\fR
at the end of an unsuccessful compilation, \fI$warning_cmd\fR at the
of an otherwise successful compilation that gives warnings about
undefined citations or references or about multiply defined
references. If any of above variables is undefined or blank (the
default situation), then the corresponding command is not executed.

However, when \fI$warning_cmd\fR is not set, then in the case of a
compilation with warnings about references or citations, but with no
other error, one or other of \fI$success_cmd\fR or \fI$failure_cmd\fR
is used (if it is set) according to the setting of
\fI$warnings_as_errors\fR.

An example of a simple setting of these variables is as follows

    $compiling_cmd = "xdotool search --name \\"%D\\" set_window --name \\"%D compiling\\"";
    $success_cmd   = "xdotool search --name \\"%D\\" set_window --name \\"%D OK\\"";
    $warning_cmd   = "xdotool search --name \\"%D\\" ".
                     "set_window --name \\"%D CITE/REF ISSUE\\"";
    $failure_cmd   = "xdotool search --name \\"%D\\" set_window --name \\"%D FAILURE\\"";

These assume that the program \fIxdotool\fR is installed, that the
previewer is using an X-Window system for display, and that the title
of the window contains the name of the displayed file, as it normally
does.  When the commands are executed, the placeholder string %D is replaced by
the name of the destination file, which is the previewed file.  The
above commands result in an appropriate string being appended to the
filename in the window title: " compiling", " OK", or " FAILURE".  

Other placeholders that can be used are %S, %T, and %R, with %S and %T
normally being identical. These can be useful for a command changing
the title of the edit window. The visual indication in a window title
can useful, since the user does not have to keep shifting attention to
the (possibly hidden) compilation window to know the status of the
compilation.

More complicated situations can best be handled by defining a Perl
subroutine to invoke the necessary commands, and using the "internal"
keyword in the definitions to get the subroutine to be invoked.  (See
the section "Format of Command Specifications" for how to do this.)

Naturally, the above settings that invoke the \fIxdotool\fR program
are only applicable when the X-Window system is used for the relevant
window(s).  For other cases, you will have to find what software
solutions are available.  

.TP
.B @cus_dep_list [()]
Custom dependency list -- see section on "Custom Dependencies".
.TP
.B @default_excluded_files [()]
When \fIlatexmk\fR is invoked with no files specified on the command
line, then, by default, it will process all files in the current
directory with the extension .tex.  (In general, it will process the
files specified in the \fI@default_files\fR variable.)

But sometimes you want to exclude particular files from this default
list.  In that case you can specify the excluded files in the array
\fI@default_excluded_files\fR.  For example if you wanted to process
all .tex files with the exception of common.tex, which is a not a
standard alone LaTeX file but a file input by some or all of the
others, you could do

     @default_files = ("*.tex");

     @default_excluded_files = ("common.tex");

If you have a variable or large number of files to be processed, this
method saves you from having to list them in detail in
\fI@default_files\fR and having to update the list every time you
change the set of files to be processed.

Notes: 1. This variable has no effect except when no files are
specified on the \fIlatexmk\fR command line.  2. Wildcards are allowed
in \fI@default_excluded_files\fR.
.TP
.B @default_files [("*.tex")]
Default list of files to be processed.  

If no filenames are specified on the command line,
\fIlatexmk\fR processes all tex files specified in the \fI@default_files\fR
variable, which by default is set to all tex files ("*.tex") in the
current directory.  This is a convenience: just run \fIlatexmk\fR and
it will process an appropriate set of files.  But sometimes you want
only some of these files to be processed.  In this case you can list
the files to be processed by setting
\fI@default_files\fR in an initialization file
(e.g., the file "latexmkrc" in the current directory).  Then if no
files are specified on the command line then the files you specify by
setting \fI@default_files\fR are processed.

Three examples:

     @default_files = ("paper_current");

     @default_files = ("paper1", "paper2.tex");

     @default_files = ("*.tex", "*.dtx");

Note that more than file may be given, and that the default extension
is ".tex".  Wild cards are allowed.  The parentheses are because
\fI@default_files\fR is an array variable, i.e., a sequence of
filename specifications is possible.

If you want \fIlatexmk\fR to process all .tex files with a few
exceptions, see the \fI@default_excluded_files\fR array variable.
.TP
.B $dependents_phony [0]
If a list of dependencies is output, this variable determines whether
to include a phony target for each source file.  If you use the
dependents list in a Makefile, the dummy rules work around errors make
gives if you remove header files without updating the Makefile to
match.
.TP
.B $dependents_list [0]
Whether to display a list(s) of dependencies at the end of a run.

.TP
.B $deps_escape ["none"]
This variable determines which kind of escaping of space characters to use
in dependency lists. The possible values are "none", "unix", "nmake",
corresponding respectively to no escaping, escaping with a "\\" suitable
for standard Unix make, and escaping with "^", suitable for Microsoft's
nmake.

Currently the only character escaped is a space, since that is particularly
common in file names and directory names.  There are other characters that
would need escaping if a dependency list is to be used as-is by a make
program; but those characters (e.g., "$") commonly cause difficulties when
used for .tex documents.  Moreover, the detailed rules for which characters
need to be escaped depends on the version of make.

.TP
.B $deps_file ["-"]
Name of file to receive list(s) of dependencies at the end of a run,
to be used if \fI$dependents_list\fR is set.  If the filename is "-",
then the dependency list is set to stdout (i.e., normally the screen).

.TP
.B $do_cd [0]
Whether to change working directory to the directory specified for the
main source file before processing it.  The default behavior is not to
do this, which is the same as the behavior of \fI*latex\fR
programs.  This variable is set by the \fB-cd\fR and
\fB-cd-\fR options on \fIlatexmk\fR's command line.
.TP
.B $dvi_filter [empty]
The dvi file filter to be run on the newly produced dvi file before
other processing.  Equivalent to specifying the \fB-dF\fR option.

.TP
.B $dvilualatex ["dvilualatex %O %S"]
Specifies the command line to invoke
the dvilualatex program.  Note that as with other programs, you
can use this variable not just to change the name of the program used,
but also specify options to the program.  E.g.,

	$dvilualatex = "dvilualatex --src-specials %O %S";

To do a coordinated setting of all of \fI$dvilualatex\fR, \fI$hilatex\fR,
\fI$latex\fR, \fI$pdflatex\fR, \fI$lualatex\fR, and \fI$xelatex\fR, see the
section "Advanced Configuration".

.TP
.B $dvi_mode [See below for default]
If one, generate a dvi version of the document by use of latex.  
Equivalent to the \fB-dvi\fR option.

If 2, generate a dvi version of the document by use of dvilualatex.  
Equivalent to the \fB-dvilua\fR option.

The variable $dvi_mode defaults to 0, but if no explicit requests are
made for other types of file (postscript, pdf), then $dvi_mode will be
set to 1.  In addition, if a request for a file for which a .dvi file
is a prerequisite and $dvi_mode is zero, then $dvi_mode is set to 1.


.TP
.B $dvilualatex_silent_switch  ["-interaction=batchmode"]
Switch(es) for the \fIdvilualatex\fR program (specified in the variable
\fI$dvilualatex\fR) when silent mode is on.

See details of the \fI$latex_silent_switch\fR for other information
that equally applies to \fI$dvilualatex_silent_switch\fR.

.TP
.B $dvi_previewer ["start xdvi %O %S" under UNIX]
The command to invoke a dvi-previewer.
[Under MS-Windows the default is "start"; then \fIlatexmk\fR arranges to
use the MS-Windows \fIstart\fR program, which will cause to be run
whatever command the system has associated with .dvi files.]

\fBImportant note\fR: Normally you will want to have a previewer run
detached, so that \fIlatexmk\fR doesn't wait for the previewer to
terminate before continuing its work.  So normally you should prefix
the command by "start ", which flags to \fIlatexmk\fR that it should
do the detaching of the previewer itself (by whatever method is
appropriate to the operating system).  But sometimes letting
\fIlatexmk\fR do the detaching is not appropriate (for a variety of
non-trivial reasons), so you should put the "start " bit in
yourself, whenever it is needed.
.TP
.B $dvi_previewer_landscape ["start xdvi %O %S"]
The command to invoke a dvi-previewer in landscape mode.
[Under MS-Windows the default is "start"; then \fIlatexmk\fR arranges to
use the MS-Windows \fIstart\fR program, which will cause to be run
whatever command the system has associated with .dvi files.]
.TP
.B $dvipdf ["dvipdf -dALLOWPSTRANSPARENCY %O %S %D"]
Command to convert .dvi to .pdf file.  A common reconfiguration is to
use the dvipdfm command, which needs its arguments in a different order:

     $dvipdf = "dvipdfm %O -o %D %S";

WARNING: The default dvipdf script generates pdf files with bitmapped
fonts, which do not look good when viewed by acroread.  That script
should be modified to give dvips the options "-P pdf" to ensure that
type 1 fonts are used in the pdf file.
.TP
.B $dvipdf_silent_switch ["-q"]
Switch(es) for dvipdf program when silent mode is on.

N.B. The standard dvipdf program runs silently, so adding the silent
switch has no effect, but is actually innocuous.  But if an
alternative program is used, e.g., dvipdfmx, then the silent switch
has an effect.  The default setting is correct for \fIdvipdfm\fR and
\fIdvipdfmx\fR.
.TP
.B $dvips ["dvips %O -o %D %S"]
The program to used as a filter to convert a .dvi file to a .ps file.  
If pdf is going to be generated from pdf, then the value of the
\fI$dvips_pdf_switch\fR variable -- see below -- will be included in
the options substituted for "%O".
.TP
.B $dvips_landscape ["dvips -tlandscape %O -o %D %S"]
The program to used as a filter to convert a .dvi file to a .ps file
in landscape mode.
.TP
.B $dvips_pdf_switch ["-P pdf"]
Switch(es) for \fIdvips\fR program when pdf file is to be generated
from .ps file. 
.TP
.B $dvips_silent_switch ["-q"]
Switch(es) for \fIdvips\fR program when silent mode is on.
.TP
.B $dvi_update_command [""]
When the dvi previewer is set to be updated by running a command, this
is the command that is run.  See the information for the variable
\fI$dvi_update_method\fR for further information, and see information
on the variable \fI$pdf_update_method\fR for an example for the
analogous case of a pdf previewer.
.TP
.B $dvi_update_method [2 under UNIX, 1 under MS-Windows]
How the dvi viewer updates its display when the dvi file has changed.
The values here apply equally to the \fI$pdf_update_method\fR and to
the \fI$ps_update_method\fR variables.
    0 => update is automatic, 
    1=> manual update by user, which may only mean a mouse click on the
viewer's window or may mean a more serious action.
    2 => Send the signal, whose number is in the variable
\fI$dvi_update_signal\fR.  The default value under UNIX is
suitable for \fIxdvi\fR. 
    3 => Viewer cannot do an update, because it locks the file. (As with
\fIacroread\fR under MS-Windows.)
    4 => run a command to do the update.  The command is specified by
the variable \fI$dvi_update_command\fR.   

See information on the variable \fI$pdf_update_method\fR for an
example of updating by command.
.TP
.B $dvi_update_signal [Under UNIX: SIGUSR1, which is a system-dependent value]
The number of the signal that is sent to the dvi viewer when it is
updated by sending a signal -- see the information on the variable
\fI$dvi_update_method\fR.  The default value is the one appropriate
for \fIxdvi\fR on a UNIX system.
.TP
.B $emulate_aux [1]
Whether to emulate the use of aux directory when $aux_dir and $out_dir are
different, rather than using the \fB-aux-directory\fR option for the *latex
programs.  (MiKTeX supports \fB-aux-directory\fR, but TeXLive doesn't.)

If you use a version of *latex that doesn't support \fB-aux-directory\fR,
e.g., TeXLive, latexmk will automatically switch aux_dir emulation on after
the first run of *latex, because it will find the .log file in the wrong 
place.  But it is better to set \fI$emulate_aux\fR to 1 in an rc file, or
equivalently to use the \fB-emulate-aux-dir\fR option. This emulation mode
works equally well with MiKTeX.

Aux directory emulation means that when *latex is invoked, the \fIoutput\fR
directory provided to *latex is set to be the desired aux directory. After
that, any files that need to be in the output directory will be moved
there by latexmk. (These are the files with
extensions .dvi, .ps, .pdf, .synctex, .synctex.gz, and, depending on the
setting of the \fI$fls_uses_out_dir\fR variable, also the .fls file.)

.TP
.B $failure_cmd [undefined]
See the documentation for \fI$compiling_cmd\fR.

.TP
.B $fdb_ext ["fdb_latexmk"]
The extension of the file which \fIlatexmk\fR generates to contain a
database of information on source files.  You will not normally need
to change this.

.TP
.B @file_not_found
This an array of Perl regular expressions that are patterns to find
messages in the .log file from a run of *latex that indicate that a file
was looked for and not found.  To see the current default set, you should
look at the definition of \fI@file_not_found\fR in the latexmk.pl file.

In the regular expression, the string for the name of the missing file
should be enclosed in parentheses.  That carries the implication that after
latexmk gets a successful match to the pattern, the variable $1 is set to
the filename, which is then picked up by latexmk.

If you happen to encounter a package that gives a missing file message of a
different form than one that matches one of the built-in patterns, you can
add another pattern to the array.  An example would be

    push @file_not_found, '^No file\\\\s+(.+)\\\\s*$';

The regular expression itself is

     ^Missing file\\s+(.+)\\s*$

But the corresponding string specification in the push statement has to
have the backslashes doubled.  

This regular expression matches a line that starts with 'No file', then has
one or more white space characters, then any number of characters forming
the filename, then possible white space, and finally the end of the line.
(See documentation on Perl regular expressions for details.)

.TP
.B $filetime_causality_threshold [5]
The use of this variable is as follows:  At a number of places, latexmk
needs to determine whether a particular file has been produced during a
just-concluded run of some rule/program or is leftover from a previous
run. (An example is the production of a .bcf file by the biblatex package
during a run of *latex to provide bibliographic information to the biber
program.  If a .bcf file is not produced during a current run of *latex,
but is leftover from a previous run, then latexmk has to conclude that
the .tex document has changed so that biber is no longer to be used.)

Latexmk's criterion that a file has been produced during a run is that the
modification time of the file is more recent than the system time at the
beginning of the run.  Bascially, if the modification time is earlier than
this, then it is a leftover from a previous run.  However, a naive use of
the criterion can, among other things, run afoul of the granularity of how
file times are stored in some file systems, which means it is possible that
the filesystem's reported time for a file might be a second or more earlier
than the actual modification time, the exact difference being quite random.

The variable \fI$filetime_causality_threshold\fR allows an appopriate
sloppiness in latexmk's use of file modification time.  It can be quite
generous; it should merely be less than the time scale on which a human
user makes changes to source files for a document (or to configuration
files, etc).

.TP
.B $fls_uses_out_dir [0]
This variable determines whether or not the .fls file should be in the
output directory instead of the natural directory, which is the aux
directory.  If the variable is nonzero, the .fls file is to be in the output
directory.  See the section AUXILIARY AND OUTPUT DIRECTORIES for more
details about these directories.  The rationale for the existence of the
variable \fI$fls_uses_aux_dir\fR is explained there.

In all cases, if \fIlatexmk\fR finds that an .fls file has been generated in
the opposite directory to the one specified by \fI$fls_uses_out_dir\fR, it
copies the file to the other directory (aux or output directory as
appropriate).  The file is copied rather than simply moved, to avoid
potential clashes with other software that assumes the .fls file is
generated in the directory it was written to by *latex. Thus the effect an
incorrect setting of \fI$fls_uses_out_dir\fR is only to cause a superfluous
copy of the .fls file to be generated.

.TP
.B $force_mode [0]
If nonzero, continue processing past minor \fIlatex\fR errors 
including unrecognized cross references.  Equivalent to specifying the
\fB-f\fR option.

.TP
.B @generated_exts [( 'aux', 'bcf', 'fls', 'idx', 'ind', 'lof', 'lot', 'out', 'toc', 'blg', 'ilg', 'log', 'xdv' )]

This contains a list of extensions for files that are generated during
processing, and that should be deleted during a main clean up operation, as
invoked by the command line option \fB-c\fR.  (The use of \fB-C\fR or
\fB-gg\fR gives this clean up and more.)  

The default values are extensions for standard files generated by 
*latex, bibtex, and the like.  (Note that the clean up also deletes the
fdb_latexmk file, but that's separately coded into latexmk, currently.)

After initialization of latexmk and the processing of its command line, the
items in \fIclean_ext\fR are appended to \fI@generated_exts\fR.  So these
two variables have the same meaning (contrary to older versions of
latexmk).

The items in \fI@generated_exts\fR are normally extensions of files, whose
base name is the same as the main tex file.  But it is also possible to
specify patterns including that basename --- see the explanation of the
variable \fI$clean_ext\fR.   

In addition to specifying files to be deleted in a clean up, latexmk uses
the same specification to assist its examination of changes in source
files: Under some situations it needs to find those changes in files (since
a previous run) that are expected to be due to the user editing a file.
This contrasts with the cases of files that are generated by some program
run by latexmk and that differ from the results of the previous run.  This
use of \fI@generated_exts\fR is normally unimportant, given the usual
accuracy of latexmk's other ways of determining these generated files.

A convenient way to add an extra extension to the list, without losing
the already defined ones is to use a push command in the line in an
RC file.  E.g.,

                push @generated_exts, "end";

adds the extension "end" to the list of predefined generated
extensions.  (This extension is used by the RevTeX package, for
example.)

.TP
.B $go_mode [0]
If nonzero, process files regardless of timestamps, and is then
equivalent to the \fB-g\fR option.

.TP
.B %hash_calc_ignore_pattern
\fB!!!This variable is for experts only!!!\fR

The general rule \fIlatexmk\fR uses for determining when an extra run
of some program is needed is that one of the source files has changed.
But consider for example a latex package that causes an encapsulated
postscript file (an "eps" file) to be made that is to be read in on
the next run.  The file contains a comment line giving its creation
date and time.  On the next run the time changes, \fIlatex\fR sees
that the eps file has changed, and therefore reruns latex.  This
causes an infinite loop, that is only terminated because \fIlatexmk\fR
has a limit 
on the number of runs to guard against pathological situations.

But the changing line has no real effect, since it is a comment.  You
can instruct \fIlatex\fR to ignore the offending line as follows:

   $hash_calc_ignore_pattern{'eps'} = '^%%CreationDate: ';

This creates a rule for files with extension \fI.eps\fR about lines to
ignore.  The left-hand side is a \fIPerl\fR idiom for setting an item
in a hash.  Note that the file extension is specified without a
period.  The value, on the right-hand side, is a string containing a
regular expression.  (See documentation on \fIPerl\fR for how they
are to be specified in general.)  This particular regular expression
specifies that lines beginning with "%%CreationDate: " are to be
ignored in deciding whether a file of the given extension \fI.eps\fR
has changed.

There is only one regular expression available for each extension.  If
you need more one pattern to specify lines to ignore, then you need to
combine the patterns into a single regular expression.  The simplest
method is separate the different simple patterns by a vertical bar
character (indicating "alternation" in the jargon of regular
expressions).  For example,

   $hash_calc_ignore_pattern{'eps'} = '^%%CreationDate: |^%%Title: ';

causes lines starting with either "^%%CreationDate: " or "^%%Title: "
to be ignored.  

It may happen that a pattern to be ignored is specified in, for
example, in a system or user initialization file, and you wish to
remove this in a file that is read later.  To do this, you use Perl's
delete function, e.g.,

    delete $hash_calc_ignore_pattern{'eps'};

.TP
.B $hilatex ["hilatex %O %S"]
specifies the command line for the hilatex program.  

.TP
.B $hnt_mode [0]
Whether to generate a hnt version of the document by use of hilatex.  Can
be turned on by the use of the \fB-hnt\fR option.

.TP
.B $jobname [""]

This specifies the jobname, i.e., the basename that is used for
generated files (.aux, .log, .dvi, .ps, .pdf, etc).  If this variable
is a null string, then the basename is the basename of the main tex
file.
(At present, the string in \fI$jobname\fR should not contain spaces.)

The placeholder '%A' is permitted. This will be substituted by the
basename of the TeX file.  The primary purpose is when a variety of
tex files are to be processed, and you want to use a different jobname
for each but one that is distinct for each. Thus if you wanted to
compare compilations of a set of files on different operating systems,
with distinct filenames for all the cases, you could set

   $jobname = "%A-$^O";

in an initialization file.  (Here \fI$^O\fR is a variable provided by
perl that contains perl's name for the operating system.)  

Suppose you had .tex files test1.tex and test2.tex.  Then when you run

   latexmk -pdf *.tex

both files will be compiled.  The .aux, .log, and .pdf files will have
basenames test1-MSWin32 ante test2-MSWin32 on a MS-Windows system,
test1-darwin and test2-darwin on an OS-X system, and a variety of
similar cases on linux systems.

.TP
.B $kpsewhich ["kpsewhich %S"]
The program called to locate a source file when the name alone is not
sufficient.  Most filenames used by \fIlatexmk\fR have sufficient path
information to be found directly.  But sometimes, notably when a .bib
or a .bst file is found from the log file of a \fIbibtex\fR or
\fIbiber\fR run, only the base name of the file is known, but not its
path. The program specified by \fI$kpsewhich\fR is used to find it.

(\fIFor advanced users:\fR Because of the different way in which
\fIlatexmk\fR uses the command specified in \fI$kpsewhich\fR, some of
the possibilities listed in the FORMAT OF COMMAND SPECIFICATIONS do
not apply.  The \fIinternal\fR and \fIstart\fR keywords are not
available. A simple command specification with possible options and
then "%S" is all that is guaranteed to work.  Note that for other
commands, "%S" is substituted by a single source file. In contrast,
for \fI$kpsewhich\fR, "%S" may be substituted by a long list of
space-separated filenames, each of which is quoted.  The result on
STDOUT of running the command is then piped to \fIlatexmk\fR.)

See also the \fI@BIBINPUTS\fR variable for another way that \fIlatexmk\fR
also uses to try to locate files; it applies only in the case of .bib
files.

.TP
.B $kpsewhich_show [0]
Whether to show diagnostics about invocations of \fIkpsewhich\fR: the
command line use to invoke it and the results.  These diagnostics are
shown if \fI$kpsewhich_show\fR is non-zero or if diagnostics mode is
on.  (But in the second case, lots of other diagnostics are also
shown.)  Without these diagnostics there is nothing visible in
\fIlatexmk\fR's screen output about invocations of \fIkpsewhich\fR.

.TP
.B $landscape_mode [0]
If nonzero, run in landscape mode, using the landscape mode previewers and
dvi to postscript converters.  Equivalent to the \fB-l\fR option.
Normally not needed with current previewers.

.TP
.B $latex ["latex %O %S"]
Specifies the command line for
the LaTeX processing program.  Note that as with other programs, you
can use this variable not just to change the name of the program used,
but also specify options to the program.  E.g.,

	$latex = "latex --src-specials %O %S";

To do a coordinated setting of all of \fI$dvilualatex\fR, \fI$hilatex\fR,
\fI$latex\fR, \fI$pdflatex\fR, \fI$lualatex\fR, and \fI$xelatex\fR, see the
section "Advanced Configuration".

.TP
.B %latex_input_extensions
This variable specifies the extensions tried by \fIlatexmk\fR when it finds
that a LaTeX run resulted in an error that a file has not been found,
and the file is given without an extension.  This typically happens when
LaTeX commands of the form \\input{file} or \\includegraphics{figure},
when the relevant source file does not exist.

In this situation, \fIlatexmk\fR searches for custom dependencies to make
the missing file(s), but restricts it to the extensions specified by
the variable %latex_input_extensions.  The default extensions 
are 'tex' and 'eps'.

(For Perl experts: %latex_input_extensions is a hash whose keys are
the extensions.  The values are irrelevant.)  Two subroutines are
provided for manipulating this and the related variable
%pdflatex_input_extensions, add_input_ext and remove_input_ext.  They
are used as in the following examples are possible lines in an
initialization file:

    remove_input_ext( 'latex', 'tex' );

removes the extension 'tex' from latex_input_extensions

    add_input_ext( 'latex', 'asdf' );

add the extension 'asdf to latex_input_extensions.  (Naturally with
such an extension, you should have made an appropriate custom
dependency for \fIlatexmk\fR, and should also have done the appropriate
programming in the LaTeX source file to enable the file to be read.
The standard extensions are handled by LaTeX and its graphics/graphicx
packages.)
.TP
.B $latex_silent_switch ["-interaction=batchmode"]
Switch(es) for the LaTeX processing program when silent mode is on.

If you use MikTeX, you may prefer the results if you configure the
options to include -c-style-errors, e.g., by the following line in an
initialization file

  $latex_silent_switch = "-interaction=batchmode -c-style-errors";

.TP
.B $lpr ["lpr  %O %S" under UNIX/Linux, \(dqNONE lpr\(dq under MS-Windows]
The command to print postscript files.

Under MS-Windows (unlike UNIX/Linux), there is no standard program for
printing files.  But there are ways you can do it.  For example, if
you have \fIgsview\fR installed, you could use it with the option "/p":

    $lpr = '"c:/Program Files/Ghostgum/gsview/gsview32.exe" /p';

If \fIgsview\fR is installed in a different directory, you will need to make
the appropriate change.  Note the combination of single and double
quotes around the name.  The single quotes specify that this is a
string to be assigned to the configuration variable \fI$lpr\fR.  The double
quotes are part of the string passed to the operating system to get
the command obeyed; this is necessary because one part of the command
name ("Program Files") contains a space which would otherwise be
misinterpreted.
.TP
.B $lpr_dvi ["NONE lpr_dvi"]
The printing program to print dvi files.
.TP
.B $lpr_pdf ["NONE lpr_pdf"]
The printing program to print pdf files.

Under MS-Windows you could set this to use \fIgsview\fR, if it is installed,
e.g.,

    $lpr = '"c:/Program Files/Ghostgum/gsview/gsview32.exe" /p';

If \fIgsview\fR is installed in a different directory, you will need to make
the appropriate change.  Note the double quotes around the name: this
is necessary because one part of the command name ("Program Files")
contains a space which would otherwise be misinterpreted. 
.TP
.B $lualatex ["lualatex %O %S"]
Specifies the command line for
the LaTeX processing program that is to be used when the \fIlualatex\fR
program is called for (e.g., by the option \fB-lualatex\fR.

To do a coordinated setting of all of \fI$dvilualatex\fR, \fI$hilatex\fR,
\fI$latex\fR, \fI$pdflatex\fR, \fI$lualatex\fR, and \fI$xelatex\fR, see the
section "Advanced Configuration".

.TP
.B %lualatex_input_extensions
This variable specifies the extensions tried by \fIlatexmk\fR when it finds
that a \fIlualatex\fR run resulted in an error that a file has not been found,
and the file is given without an extension.  This typically happens when
LaTeX commands of the form \\input{file} or \\includegraphics{figure},
when the relevant source file does not exist.

In this situation, \fIlatexmk\fR searches for custom dependencies to make
the missing file(s), but restricts it to the extensions specified by
the variable %pdflatex_input_extensions.  The default extensions 
are 'tex', 'pdf', 'jpg, and 'png'.

See details of the \fI%latex_input_extensions\fR for other information
that equally applies to \fI%lualatex_input_extensions\fR.
.TP
.B $lualatex_silent_switch  ["-interaction=batchmode"]
Switch(es) for the \fIlualatex\fR program (specified in the variable
\fI$lualatex\fR) when silent mode is on.

See details of the \fI$latex_silent_switch\fR for other information
that equally applies to \fI$lualatex_silent_switch\fR.

.B $make ["make"]
The make processing program.

.B $makeindex ["makeindex %O -o %D %S"]
The index processing program.
.TP
.B $makeindex_fudge [0]
When using makeindex, whether to change directory to $aux_dir before running
makeindex.  Set to 1 if $aux_dir is not an explicit subdirectory of current
directory, otherwise makeindex will refuse to write its output and log
files, for security reasons. 
.TP
.B $makeindex_silent_switch ["-q"]
\fBSwitch(es)\fR for the index processing program when silent mode is on.
.TP
.B $max_repeat  [5]
The maximum number of times \fIlatexmk\fR will run \fI*latex\fR
before deciding that there may be an infinite loop and that it needs
to bail out, rather than rerunning \fI*latex\fR again to resolve
cross-references, etc.  The default value covers all normal cases.

(Note that the "etc" covers a lot of cases where one run of
\fI*latex\fR generates files to be read in on a later run.)
.TP
.B $MSWin_back_slash [1]
This configuration variable only has an effect when \fIlatexmk\fR is
running under MS-Windows.  With the default value of 1 for this variable,
when a command is executed under MS-Windows, \fIlatexmk\fR substitutes "\\"
for the separator character between components of a directory name.
Internally, \fIlatexmk\fR uses "/" for the directory separator character,
which is the character used by Unix-like systems.

For almost all programs and for almost all filenames under MS-Windows, both
"\\" and "/" are acceptable as the directory separator character, provided
at least that filenames are properly quoted.  But it is possible that
programs exist that only accept "\\" on the command line, since that is the
standard directory separator for MS-Windows.  So for safety \fIlatexmk\fR
makes the substitution from "/" to "\\", by default.

However there are also programs on MS-Windows for which a back slash "\\"
is interpreted differently than as a directory separator; for these the
directory separator should be "/".  Programs with this behavior include all
the *latex programs in the TeXLive implementation (but not the MiKTeX
implementation).  Hence if you use TeXLive on MS-Windows, then
\fI$MSWin_back_slash\fR should be set to zero.

.TP
.B $new_viewer_always [0]
This variable applies to \fIlatexmk\fR \fBonly\fR in
continuous-preview mode.  If \fI$new_viewer_always\fR is 0,
\fIlatexmk\fR will check for a previously running previewer on the
same file, and if one is running will not start a new one.  If
\fI$new_viewer_always\fR is non-zero, this check will be skipped, and
\fIlatexmk\fR will behave as if no viewer is running.

.TP
.B $out_dir [""]
If non-blank, this variable specifies the output directory.

This is the directory in which the main output files are written (dvi, ps,
pdf, synctex, synctex.gz).  In addition, if the aux directory equals the
output directory, as is the case by default, then other generated files are
in effect written to the output directory.

If \fI$out_dir\fR is blank, the output directory is the current directory
at the invocation of *latex; this is equivalent to setting \fI$out_dir\fR
to '.'.

See the section AUXILIARY AND OUTPUT DIRECTORIES for more details.


.TP
.B $out2_dir [""]
(\fIExperimental new feature.\fR)

If non-blank, this variable specifies the final-output directory, i.e., the
directory for the final output files.  If this variable is blank (its
default value), the final-output directory is the same as the output
directory.

See the description of the option \fB-out2dir\fR for an explanation of the
rationale for the idea of separate output and final-output directories.

If the final-output directory is different from the output directory, then
after a full round of compilations of the document, the relevant set of
files is copied here from the output directory.  The files copied are
specified by the \fI@out2_exts\fR variable, and by default are those with
extensions 'hnt', 'pdf', 'ps', 'synctex', 'synctex.gz', and a basename the
same as for the main *latex compilation.

.TP
.B @out2_exts [( 'hnt', 'pdf', 'ps', 'synctex', 'synctex.gz' )]

This variable lists the extensions of the files to be copied to the
final-output directory. The basename of the files is that for the main
*latex compilation (corresponding to the value specified by the placeholder
%R).  More general names may be specified in the same way as for the
\fI@generated_exts\fR variable, by inclusion of %R in a pattern, e.g.,

    push @out2_exts, '%R-2up.pdf';


.TP
.B $pdf_mode [0]
If zero, do NOT generate a pdf version of the document.
If equal to 1, generate a pdf version of the document using \fIpdflatex\fR,
using the command specified by the \fI$pdflatex\fR variable.  
If equal to 2, generate a pdf version of the document from the ps
file, by using the command specified by the \fI$ps2pdf\fR variable.  
If equal to 3, generate a pdf version of the document from the dvi
file, by using the command specified by the \fI$dvipdf\fR variable.  
If equal to 4, generate a pdf version of the document using \fIlualatex\fR,
using the command specified by the \fI$lualatex\fR variable.
If equal to 5, generate a pdf version (and an xdv version) of the
document using \fIxelatex\fR, using the commands specified by the
\fI$xelatex\fR and \fIxdvipdfmx\fR variables.

In \fI$pdf_mode\fR=2, it is ensured that .dvi and .ps files are also made.
In \fI$pdf_mode\fR=3, it is ensured that a .dvi file is also made.
But this may be overridden by the document.
.TP
.B $pdflatex ["pdflatex %O %S"]
Specifies the command line for
the LaTeX processing program in a version that makes a pdf file instead
of a dvi file.

An example use of this variable is to add certain options to the
command line for the program, e.g.,

     $pdflatex = "pdflatex --shell-escape %O %S";

(In some earlier versions of \fIlatexmk\fR, you needed to use an assignment
to \fI$pdflatex\fR to allow the use of \fIlualatex\fR or \fIxelatex\fR
instead of \fIpdflatex\fR.  There are now separate configuration
variables for the use of \fIlualatex\fR or \fIxelatex\fR.  See
\fI$lualatex\fR and \fI$xelatex\fR.)

To do a coordinated setting of all of \fI$dvilualatex\fR, \fI$hilatex\fR,
\fI$latex\fR, \fI$pdflatex\fR, \fI$lualatex\fR, and \fI$xelatex\fR, see the
section "Advanced Configuration".

.TP
.B %pdflatex_input_extensions
This variable specifies the extensions tried by \fIlatexmk\fR when it finds
that a \fIpdflatex\fR run resulted in an error that a file has not been found,
and the file is given without an extension.  This typically happens when
LaTeX commands of the form \\input{file} or \\includegraphics{figure},
when the relevant source file does not exist.

In this situation, \fIlatexmk\fR searches for custom dependencies to make
the missing file(s), but restricts it to the extensions specified by
the variable %pdflatex_input_extensions.  The default extensions 
are 'tex', 'pdf', 'jpg, and 'png'.

See details of the \fI%latex_input_extensions\fR for other information
that equally applies to \fI%pdflatex_input_extensions\fR.
.TP
.B $pdflatex_silent_switch  ["-interaction=batchmode"]
Switch(es) for the \fIpdflatex\fR program (specified in the variable
\fI$pdflatex\fR) when silent mode is on.

See details of the \fI$latex_silent_switch\fR for other information
that equally applies to \fI$pdflatex_silent_switch\fR.
.TP
.B $pdf_previewer ["start acroread %O %S"]
The command to invoke a pdf-previewer.

On MS-Windows, the default is changed to "cmd /c start """; under more recent versions of
Windows, this will cause to be run whatever command the system has
associated with .pdf files.  But this may be undesirable if this
association is to \fIacroread\fR -- see the notes in the explanation
of the \fB-pvc\fR option.]  

On OS-X the default is changed to "open %S", which results in OS-X
starting up (and detaching) the viewer associated with the file.  By
default, for pdf files this association is to OS-X's preview, which is
quite satisfactory.

\fBWARNING\fR:  Problem under MS-Windows:
if acroread is used as the pdf previewer, and it is
actually viewing a pdf file, the pdf file cannot be updated.  Thus
makes acroread a bad choice of previewer if you use \fIlatexmk\fR's
previous-continuous mode (option \fB-pvc\fR) under MS-windows.
This problem does not occur if, for example, \fISumatraPDF\fR or \fIgsview\fR is
used to view pdf files.

\fBImportant note\fR: Normally you will want to have a previewer run
detached, so that \fIlatexmk\fR doesn't wait for the previewer to
terminate before continuing its work.  So normally you should prefix
the command by "start ", which flags to \fIlatexmk\fR that it should
do the detaching of the previewer itself (by whatever method is
appropriate to the operating system).  But sometimes letting
\fIlatexmk\fR do the detaching is not appropriate (for a variety of
non-trivial reasons), so you should put the "start " bit in
yourself, whenever it is needed.
.TP
.B $pdf_update_command [""]
When the pdf previewer is set to be updated by running a command, this
is the command that is run.  See the information for the variable
\fI$pdf_update_method\fR. 
.TP
.B $pdf_update_method [1 under UNIX, 3 under MS-Windows]
How the pdf viewer updates its display when the pdf file has
changed. See the information on the variable \fI$dvi_update_method\fR
for the codes.  (Note that information needs be changed slightly so
that for the value 4, to run a command to do the update, the command
is specified by the variable \fI$pdf_update_command\fR, and for the
value 2, to specify update by signal, the signal is specified by
\fI$pdf_update_signal\fR.)

Note that acroread under MS-Windows (but not UNIX) locks the pdf file, so
the default value is then 3.  

Arranging to use a command to get a previewer explicitly updated
requires three variables to be set.  For example:

    $pdf_previewer = "start xpdf -remote %R %O %S";
    $pdf_update_method = 4;
    $pdf_update_command = "xpdf -remote %R -reload";

The first setting arranges for the xpdf program to be used in its
"remote server mode", with the server name specified as the rootname
of the TeX file.  The second setting arranges for updating to be done
in response to a command, and the third setting sets the update command.
.TP
.B $pdf_update_signal [Under UNIX: SIGHUP, which is a system-dependent value]
The number of the signal that is sent to the pdf viewer when it is
updated by sending a signal -- see the information on the variable
\fI$pdf_update_method\fR.  The default value is the one appropriate
for \fIgv\fR on a UNIX system.
.TP
.B $pid_position[1 under UNIX, -1 under MS-Windows]     
The variable \fI$pid_position\fR is used to
specify which word in lines of the output from \fI$pscmd\fR
corresponds to the process ID.  The first word in the line is numbered
0.  The default value of 1 (2nd word in line) is correct for Solaris
2.6, Linux, and OS-X with their default settings of \fI$pscmd\fR.

Setting the variable to -1 is used to indicate that
\fI$pscmd\fR is not to be used.
.TP
.B $postscript_mode [0]
If nonzero, generate a postscript version of the document.  
Equivalent to the \fB-ps\fR option.

If some other request is made for which a postscript file is needed,
then $postscript_mode will be set to 1.
.TP
.B $pre_tex_code ['']

Sets TeX code to be executed before inputting the source file.  This
works if the relevant one of \fI$latex\fR, etc contains a suitable
command line with a %P or %U substitution.  For example you could do

     $latex = 'latex %O %P';
     $pre_tex_code = '\\AtBeginDocument{An initial message\\par}';

To set all of \fI$latex\fR, \fI$pdflatex\fR, \fI$lualatex\fR, and
\fI$xelatex\fR you could use the subroutine \fIalt_tex_cmds\fR:

     &alt_tex_cmds;
     $pre_tex_code = '\\AtBeginDocument{An initial message\\par}';


.TP
.B $preview_continuous_mode [0]
If nonzero, run a previewer to view the document, and
continue running \fIlatexmk\fR to keep .dvi up-to-date.  Equivalent to
the \fB-pvc\fR option.
Which previewer is run depends on the other settings, see the command
line options \fB-view=\fR, and the variable \fI$view\fR.  
.TP
.B $preview_mode [0]
If nonzero, run a previewer to preview the document.
Equivalent to the \fB-pv\fR option.  
Which previewer is run depends on the other settings, see the command
line options \fB-view=\fR, and the variable \fI$view\fR.  
.TP
.B $printout_mode [0]
If nonzero, print the document using the command specified in the
\fI$lpr\fR variable.  Equivalent to the
\fB-p\fR option.  This is recommended \fBnot\fR to be set from an RC
file, otherwise you could waste lots of paper.
.TP
.B $print_type = ["auto"]
Type of file to printout: possibilities are "auto", "dvi", "none",
"pdf", or "ps".   See the option \fB-print=\fR for the meaning of the
"auto" value.
.TP
.B $pscmd
Command used to get all the processes currently run by the user.  The
-pvc option uses the command specified by the variable \fI$pscmd\fR to
determine if there is an already running previewer, and to find the
process ID (needed if \fIlatexmk\fR needs to signal the previewer
about file changes).  

Each line of the output of this command is assumed to correspond to
one process.  See the \fI$pid_position\fR variable for how the process
number is determined.

The default for \fIpscmd\fR is "NONE" under MS-Windows and cygwin
(i.e., the command is not used), "ps -ww -u $ENV{USER}" under 
OS-X, and 
"ps -f -u $ENV{USER}" under other operating systems (including Linux).
In these specifications "$ENV{USER}" is substituted by the username.
.TP
.B $ps2pdf ["ps2pdf -dALLOWPSTRANSPARENCY %O %S %D"]
Command to convert .ps to .pdf file.  
.TP
.B $ps_filter [empty]
The postscript file filter to be run on the newly produced postscript
file before other processing.  Equivalent to specifying the \fB-pF\fR
option.
.TP
.B $ps_previewer ["start gv %O %S", but "start %O %S" under MS-Windows]
The command to invoke a ps-previewer.  (The default under MS-Windows
will cause to be run whatever command the system has associated 
with .ps files.)

Note that \fIgv\fR could be used with the -watch option updates its display
whenever the postscript file changes, whereas ghostview does not.
However, different versions of \fIgv\fR have slightly different ways of
writing this option.  You can configure this variable appropriately.

\fBWARNING\fR: Linux systems may have installed one (or more) versions
of \fIgv\fR under different names, e.g., \fIggv\fR, \fIkghostview\fR,
etc, but perhaps not one actually called \fIgv\fR.

\fBImportant note\fR: Normally you will want to have a previewer run
detached, so that \fIlatexmk\fR doesn't wait for the previewer to
terminate before continuing its work.  So normally you should prefix
the command by "start ", which flags to \fIlatexmk\fR that it should
do the detaching of the previewer itself (by whatever method is
appropriate to the operating system).  But sometimes letting
\fIlatexmk\fR do the detaching is not appropriate (for a variety of
non-trivial reasons), so you should put the "start " bit in
yourself, whenever it is needed.

.TP
.B $ps_previewer_landscape ["start gv -swap %O %S", but "start %O %S" under MS-Windows]
The command to invoke a ps-previewer in landscape mode.
.TP
.B $ps_update_command [""]
When the postscript previewer is set to be updated by running a command, this
is the command that is run.  See the information for the variable
\fI$ps_update_method\fR. 
.TP
.B $ps_update_method [0 under UNIX, 1 under MS-Windows]
How the postscript viewer updates its display when the .ps file has
changed. See the information on the variable \fI$dvi_update_method\fR
for the codes.  (Note that information needs be changed slightly so
that for the value 4, to run a command to do the update, the command
is specified by the variable \fI$ps_update_command\fR, and for the
value 2, to specify update by signal, the signal is specified by
\fI$ps_update_signal\fR.)
.TP
.B $ps_update_signal [Under UNIX: SIGHUP, which is a system-dependent value]
The number of the signal that is sent to the pdf viewer when it is
updated by sending a signal -- see \fI$ps_update_method\fR.  The
default value is the one appropriate for gv on a UNIX system.
.TP
.B $pvc_timeout [0]
If this variable is nonzero, there will be a  timeout in pvc mode
after a period of inactivity.  Inactivity means a period when
\fIlatexmk\fR has detected no file changes and hence has not taken any
actions like compiling the document. The period of inactivity is in
the variable $pvc_timeout_mins.

.TP
.B $pvc_timeout_mins [30]
The period of inactivity, in minutes, after which pvc mode times out.
This is used if \fI$pvc_timeout\fR is nonzero.
.TP
.B $pvc_view_file_via_temporary [1]
The same as \fI$always_view_file_via_temporary\fR, except that it only
applies in preview-continuous mode (-pvc option).
.TP
.B $quote_filenames [1]
This specifies whether substitutions for placeholders in command
specifications (as in \fI$pdflatex\fR) are surrounded by double
quotes.  If this variable is 1 (or any other value Perl regards as
true), then quoting is done.  Otherwise quoting is omitted.  

The quoting method used by \fIlatexmk\fR is tested to work correctly under
UNIX systems (including Linux and Mac OS-X) and under MS-Windows.  It
allows the use of filenames containing special characters, notably
spaces.  (But note that many versions of \fI*latex\fR cannot
correctly deal with TeX files whose names contain spaces.  \fILatexmk\fR's
quoting only ensures that such filenames are correctly treated by the
operating system in passing arguments to programs.)
.TP
.B $rc_report [1]
After initialization, whether to give a list of the RC files read.
.TP
.B $recorder [1]
Whether to use the \fB-recorder\fR option to \fI*latex\fR.
Use of this option results in a file of extension
\fI.fls\fR containing a list of the files that these programs have
read and written.  \fILatexmk\fR will then use this file to improve
its detection of source files and generated files after a run of
\fI*latex\fR.

It is generally recommended to use this option (or to configure the
\fI$recorder\fR variable to be on.)  But it only works if
\fI*latex\fR supports the -recorder option, which is true for most
current implementations

\fINote about the name of the .fls file:\fR Most implementations of
\fI*latex\fR produce an .fls file with the same basename as the
main document's LaTeX, e.g., for Document.tex, the .fls file is
Document.fls.  However, some implementations instead produce files
named for the program, i.e., latex.fls or pdflatex.fls.  In this
second case, \fIlatexmk\fR copies the latex.fls or pdflatex.fls to a
file with the basename of the main LaTeX document, e.g., Document.fls.
.TP
.B $search_path_separator [See below for default]
The character separating paths in the environment variables TEXINPUTS,
BIBINPUTS, and BSTINPUTS.  This variable is mainly used by
\fIlatexmk\fR when the \fB-outdir\fR, \fB-output-directory\fR,
\fB-auxdir\fR, and/or \fB-aux-directory\fR options are used.  In that
case \fIlatexmk\fR needs to communicate appropriately modified search
paths to \fIbibtex\fR, \fIdvipdf\fR, \fIdvips\fR, and
\fI*latex\fR.  

[Comment to technically savvy readers: \fI*latex\fR doesn't
actually need the modified search path.  But, surprisingly,
\fIdvipdf\fR and \fIdvips\fR do, 
because sometimes graphics files get generated in the output or aux
directories.] 

The default under MSWin and Cygwin is ';' and under UNIX-like
operating systems (including Linux and OS-X) is ':'.  Normally the
defaults give correct behavior.  But there can be difficulties if your
operating system is of one kind, but some of your software is running
under an emulator for the other kind of operating system; in that case
you'll need to find out what is needed, and set
\fI$search_path_separator\fR explicitly.  (The same goes, of course,
for unusual operating systems that are not in the MSWin, Linux, OS-X,
Unix collection.)
.TP
.B $show_time [0]
Whether to show time used, both the total and for individual steps.

\fINote\fR: On MS Windows, this is clock time.  On other OSs it is the CPU
time used (by latexmk and the child processes it invokes).  The
OS-dependence is because of a limitation of Windows.  If you wish to force
the use of clock instead of CPU time, you can set

    $times_are_clock = 1;


.TP
.B $silence_logfile_warnings [0]
Whether after a run of *latex to summarize warnings in the log
file about undefined citations and references.  Setting
$silence_logfile_warnings=0 gives the summary of warnings (provided
silent mode isn't also set), and this is useful to locate undefined
citations and references without searching through the much more
verbose log file or the screen output of *latex.  But the summary
can also be excessively annoying.  The default is not to give these
warnings.  The command line options
\fB-silence_logfile_warning_list\fR and
\fB-silence_logfile_warning_list-\fR also set this variable.

Note that multiple occurrences for the same undefined object on the
same page and same line will be compressed to a single warning.

.TP
.B $silent [0]
Whether to run silently.  Setting $silent to 1 has the same effect as
the \fB-quiet\fR of \fB-silent\fR options on the command line.

.TP
.B $sleep_time [2]
The time to sleep (in seconds) between checking for source-file
changes when running with the \fB-pvc\fR option.  If non-zero, it is subject to a
minimum value give by the \fI$min_sleep_time\fR variable.  But a zero value
is also allowed.  

A value of exactly 0 gives no delay between checks for source-file changes;
it typically results in 100% CPU usage, which may not be desirable.

In old versions of latexmk, the default value of \fI$sleep_time\fR of 2 was
set to give a reasonable compromise between responsiveness in \rB-pvc\fR
mode and the amount of CPU usage.  On modern computers with fast multi-core
CPUs, a smaller value, e.g., 0.1 can give good results, especially when
working with small documents whose compilation may take well under a
second.

.TP
.B $texfile_search [""]
This is an obsolete variable, replaced by the \fI@default_files\fR
variable.  

For backward compatibility, if you choose to set
\fI$texfile_search\fR, it is a string of space-separated filenames, and
then \fIlatexmk\fR replaces \fI@default_files\fR with the filenames in
\fI$texfile_search\fR to which is added "*.tex".
.TP
.B $success_cmd [undefined]
See the documentation for $compiling_cmd.
.TP
.B $tmpdir [See below for default]
Directory to store temporary files that \fIlatexmk\fR may generate while
running.  

The default under MSWindows (including cygwin), is to set
\fI$tmpdir\fR to the value of the first of whichever of the system
environment variables TMPDIR or TEMP exists, otherwise to the current
directory.  Under other operating systems (expected to be UNIX/Linux,
including OS-X), the default is the value of the system environment
variable TMPDIR if it exists, otherwise "/tmp".

.TP
.B $use_make_for_missing_files [0]
Whether to use \fImake\fR to try and make files that are missing after
a run of \fI*latex\fR, and for which a custom
dependency has not been found.  This is generally useful only when
\fIlatexmk\fR is used as part of a bigger project which is built by
using the \fImake\fR program.

Note that once a missing file has been made, no further calls to
\fImake\fR will be made on a subsequent run of \fIlatexmk\fR to update
the file.  Handling this problem is the job of a suitably defined
Makefile.  See the section "USING \fIlatexmk\fR WITH \fImake\fR" for
how to do this.  The intent of calling \fImake\fR from \fIlatexmk\fR
is merely to detect dependencies.

.TP
.B $user_deleted_file_treated_as_changed [0]
Whether when testing for changed files, a user file that changes status
from existing to non-existing should be regarded as changed.

The default value is 0, which implies that if a user file (as opposed to a
generated file) has been deleted since the previous run, then no
recompilation should be done.  The reasoning is that a rerun would simply
produce an error.

If the value is 1, then disappearance of a user file is treated as
triggering a rerun, but only in non-preview-continuous mode.

If the value is 2, then disappearance of a user file is treated as
triggering a rerun, always.

.TP
.B $view ["default"]
Which kind of file is to be previewed if a previewer is used.  The
possible values are "default", "dvi", "hnt", "ps", "pdf", "none".  The value 
of "default" means that the "highest" of the kinds of file generated is
to be used (among .dvi, .hnt, .ps and .pdf).

.TP
.B $warnings_as_errors [0]
Normally \fIlatexmk\fR copies the behavior of \fIlatex\fR in treating
undefined references and citations and multiply defined references as
conditions that give a warning but not an error.  The variable
\fI$warnings_as_errors\fR controls whether this behavior is modified.

When the variable is non-zero, \fIlatexmk\fR at the end of its run
will return a non-zero status code to the operating system if any of
the files processed gives a warning about problems with citations or
references (i.e., undefined citations or references or multiply
defined references).  This is \fBafter\fR \fIlatexmk\fR has completed
all the runs it needs to try and resolve references and citations.
Thus \fI$warnings_as_errors\fR being nonzero causes \fIlatexmk\fR to
treat such warnings as errors, but only when they occur on the last
run of *latex and only after processing is complete.  A non-zero
value \fI$warnings_as_errors\fR can be set by the command-line option
\fB-Werror\fR.

The default behavior is normally satisfactory in the usual
edit-compile-edit cycle.  But, for example, \fIlatexmk\fR can also be
used as part of a build process for some bigger project, e.g., for
creating documentation in the build of a software application.  Then
it is often sensible to treat citation and reference warnings as
errors that require the overall build process to be aborted.  Of
course, since multiple runs of *latex are generally needed to
resolve references and citations, what matters is \fInot\fR the
warnings on the first run, but the warnings on the \fIlast\fR run;
\fIlatexmk\fR takes this into account appropriately.

In addition, when preview-continuous mode is used, a non-zero value
for \fI$warnings_as_errors\fR changes the use of the commands
\fI$failure_cmd\fR, \fI$warning_cmd\fR, and \fI$success_cmd\fR after a
compliation.  If there are citation or reference warnings, but no
other errors, the behavior is as follows. If \fI$warning_cmd\fR is
set, it is used.  If it is not set, then then if
\fI$warnings_as_errors\fR is non-zero and \fI$failure_cmd\fR is set,
then \fI$failure_cmd\fR.  Otherwise \fI$success_cmd\fR is used, if it
is set.  (The foregoing explanation is rather complicated, because
\fIlatexmk\fR has to deal with the case that one or more of the
commands isn't set.)

.B $xdv_mode [0]
If one, generate an xdv version of the document by use of xelatex.  

.TP
.B $xdvipdfmx ["xdvipdfmx -E -o %D %O %S"]

The program to make a pdf file from an xdv file (used in conjunction
with \fIxelatex\fR when \fI$pdf_mode\fR=5).
.TP
.B $xdvipdfmx_silent_switch ["-q"]
Switch(es) for the \fIxdvipdfmx\fR program when silent mode is on.

documentation of the \fB-xelatex\fR option for some special properties
of \fIlatexmk\fR's use of \fIxelatex\fR.

\fINote about xelatex\fR: \fIlatexmk\fR uses \fIxelatex\fR to make an .xdv
rather than .pdf file, with the .pdf file being created in a separate step.
This is enforced by the use of the \fB-no-pdf\fR option.  If %O is part of
the command for invoking \fIxelatex\fR, then \fIlatexmk\fR will insert the
\fB-no-pdf\fR option automatically, otherwise you must provide the option
yourself.  See the documentation for the \fB-pdfxe\fR option for why
\fIlatexmk\fR makes a .xdv file rather than a .pdf file when \fIxelatex\fR
is used.

To do a coordinated setting of all of \fI$dvilualatex\fR, \fI$hilatex\fR,
\fI$latex\fR, \fI$pdflatex\fR, \fI$lualatex\fR, and \fI$xelatex\fR, see the
section "Advanced Configuration".

.TP
.B %xelatex_input_extensions
This variable specifies the extensions tried by \fIlatexmk\fR when it finds
that an \fIxelatex\fR run resulted in an error that a file has not been found,
and the file is given without an extension.  This typically happens when
LaTeX commands of the form \\input{file} or \\includegraphics{figure},
when the relevant source file does not exist.

In this situation, \fIlatexmk\fR searches for custom dependencies to make
the missing file(s), but restricts it to the extensions specified by
the variable %xelatex_input_extensions.  The default extensions 
are 'tex', 'pdf', 'jpg, and 'png'.

See details of the \fI%latex_input_extensions\fR for other information
that equally applies to \fI%xelatex_input_extensions\fR.

.B $xelatex_silent_switch  ["-interaction=batchmode"]
Switch(es) for the \fIxelatex\fR program (specified in the variable
\fI$xelatex\fR) when silent mode is on.

See details of the \fI$latex_silent_switch\fR for other information
that equally applies to \fI$xelatex_silent_switch\fR.



.SH CUSTOM DEPENDENCIES
.PP
In any RC file a set of custom dependencies can be set up to convert a
file with one extension to a file with another.  An example use of this
would be to allow \fIlatexmk\fR to convert a \fI.fig\fR file to
\fI.eps\fR to be included in the \fI.tex\fR file.

.SS Defining a custom dependency:
The old method of configuring \fIlatexmk\fR to use a custom dependency
was to directly manipulate the \fI@cus_dep_list\fR array that contains
information defining the custom dependencies.  (See the section "Old Method of
Defining Custom Dependencies" for details.) This method still
works, but is no longer preferred.  

A better method is to use the subroutines that allow convenient
manipulations of the custom dependency list.  These are

    add_cus_dep( fromextension, toextension, must, subroutine )
    remove_cus_dep( fromextension, toextension )
    show_cus_dep()

The arguments are as follows:
.TP
.B from extension:
The extension of the file we are converting from (e.g. "fig").
It is specified without a period.
.TP
.B to extension:
The extension of the file we are converting to (e.g. "eps").
It is specified without a period.
.TP
.B must:
If non-zero, the file from which we are converting \fBmust\fR exist, if it
doesn't exist \fIlatexmk\fR will give an error message and exit unless
the \fB-f\fR option is specified.  If \fImust\fR is zero and the file
we are converting from doesn't exist, then no action is taken.
Generally, the appropriate value of \fImust\fR is zero.
.TP
.B function:
The name of the subroutine that \fIlatexmk\fR should call to perform the
file conversion.  The first argument to the subroutine is the base name
of the file to be converted without any extension.  The subroutines are
declared in the syntax of \fIPerl\fR.  The function should return 0 if
it was successful and a nonzero number if it failed.

.PP

Naturally \fIadd_cus_dep\fR adds a custom dependency with the
specified from and to extensions.  If a custom dependency has been
previously defined (e.g., in an rcfile that was read earlier), then it
is replaced by the new one.

The subroutine \fIremove_cus_dep\fR removes the specified custom
dependency. The subroutine \fIshow_cus_dep\fR causes a list of the
currently defined custom dependencies to be sent to the screen
output.

.SS How custom dependencies are used:
An instance of a custom dependency rule is created whenever
\fIlatexmk\fR detects that a run of \fI*latex\fR needs to read a
file, like a graphics file, whose extension is the to-extension of a
custom dependency.  Then \fIlatexmk\fR examines whether a file exists
with the same name, but with the corresponding from-extension, as
specified in the custom-dependency.  If it does, then a corresponding
instance of the custom dependency is created, after which the rule is
invoked whenever the destination file (the one with the to-extension)
is out-of-date with respect to the corresponding source file.

To make the new destination file, the \fIPerl\fR subroutine specified in the
rule is invoked, with an argument that is the base name of the files
in question.  Simple cases just involve a subroutine invoking an
external program; this can be done by following the templates below,
even by those without knowledge of the \fIPerl\fR programming language.  Of
course, experts could do something much more elaborate.

One item in the specification of each custom-dependency rule, labeled
"must" above, specifies how the rule should be applied when the source
file fails to exist.

When \fIlatex\fR reports that an input file (e.g., a graphics file)
does not exist, \fIlatexmk\fR tries to find a source file and a custom
dependency that can be used to make it.  If it succeeds, then it
creates an instance of the custom dependency and invokes it to make
the missing file, after which the next pass of \fIlatex\fR etc will be
able to read the newly created file.

\fINote for advanced usage\fR: The operating system's environment
variable TEXINPUTS can be used to specify a search path for finding
files by \fIlatex\fR etc.  Correspondingly, when a missing file is
reported, \fIlatexmk\fR looks in the directories specified in
TEXINPUTS as well as in the current directory, to find a source file
from which an instance of a custom dependency can be used to make the
missing file.

.SS Function to implement custom dependency, traditional method:
The function that implements a custom dependency gets the information
on the files to be processed in two ways.  The first is through its
one argument; the argument contains the base name of the source and
destination files.  The second way is described later.

A simple and typical example of code in an initialization rcfile using
the first method is:

    add_cus_dep( 'fig', 'eps', 0, 'fig2eps' );
    sub fig2eps {
        system( "fig2dev -Leps \\"$_[0].fig\\" \\"$_[0].eps\\"" ); 
    }

The first line adds a custom dependency that converts a file with
extension "fig", as created by the \fIxfig\fR program, to an encapsulated
postscript file, with extension "eps".  The remaining lines define a
subroutine that carries out the conversion.  If a rule for converting
"fig" to "eps" files already exists (e.g., from a previously read-in
initialization file), the \fIlatexmk\fR will delete this rule before
making the new one.

Suppose \fIlatexmk\fR is using this rule to convert a file
"figure.fig" to "figure.eps".  Then it will invoke the fig2eps
subroutine defined in the above code with a single argument "figure",
which is the basename of each of the files (possibly with a path
component).  This argument is referred to by \fIPerl\fR as $_[0].  In
the example above, the subroutine uses the \fIPerl\fR command system
to invoke the program fig2dev.  The double quotes around the string
are a \fIPerl\fR idiom that signify that each string of the form of a
variable name, $_[0] in this case, is to be substituted by its value.

If the return value of the subroutine is non-zero, then \fIlatexmk\fR
will assume an error occurred during the execution of the subroutine.
In the above example, no explicit return value is given, and instead
the return value is the value returned by the last (and only)
statement, i.e., the invocation of system, which returns the value 0
on success.

If you use \fIpdflatex\fR, \fIlualatex\fR or \fIxelatex\fR instead of
\fIlatex\fR, then you will probably prefer to 
convert your graphics files to pdf format, in which case you would
replace the above code in an initialization file by

    add_cus_dep( 'fig', 'pdf, 0, 'fig2pdf' );
    sub fig2pdf {
        system( "fig2dev -Lpdf \\"$_[0].fig\\" \\"$_[0].pdf\\"" ); 
    }

\fBNote 1:\fR In the command lines given in the system commands in the
above examples, double quotes have been inserted around the file names
(implemented by '\\"' \" " COMMENT TO FOOL EDITOR INTO MATCHING DOUBLE QUOTES
in the Perl language).  They immunize the running
of the program against special characters in filenames.  Very often
these quotes are not necessary, i.e., they can be omitted.  But it is
normally safer to keep them in.  Even though the rules for quoting
vary between operating systems, command shells and individual pieces
of software, the quotes in the above examples do not cause problems in
the cases I have tested.

\fBNote 2:\fR One case in which the quotes are important is when the
files are in a subdirectory and your operating system is Microsoft
Windows.  Then the separator character for directory components can be
either a forward slash '/' or Microsoft's more usual backward
slash '\\'.  Forward slashes are generated by \fIlatexmk\fR, to maintain its
sanity from software like MiKTeX that mixes both directory
separators; but their correct use normally requires quoted filenames. 
(See a log file from a run of MiKTeX (at least in v. 2.9) for an
example of the use of both directory separators.)

\fBNote 3:\fR The subroutines implementing custom dependencies in the
examples given just have a single line invoking an external program.
That's the usual situation.  But since the subroutines are in the Perl
language, you can implement much more complicated processing if you
need it.

.SS Removing custom dependencies, and when you might need to do this:
If you have some general custom dependencies defined in the system or
user initialization file, you may find that for a particular project
they are undesirable.  So you might want to delete the unneeded ones.
A situation where this would be desirable is where there are multiple
custom dependencies with the same from-extension or the same
to-extension. In that case, \fIlatexmk\fR might choose a different one
from the one you want for a specific project.  As an example, to
remove any "fig" to "eps" rule you would use:

    remove_cus_dep( 'fig', 'eps' );

If you have complicated sets of custom dependencies, you may want to
get a listing of the custom dependencies.  This is done by using the
line 

    show_cus_dep();

in an initialization file. 

.SS Function implementing custom dependency, alternative methods:
So far the examples for functions to implement custom dependencies
have used the argument of the function to specify the base name of
converted file.  This method has been available since very old
versions of \fIlatexmk\fR, and many examples can be found, e.g., on
the web.

However in later versions of \fIlatexmk\fR the internal structure of
the implementation of its "rules" for the steps of processing,
including custom dependencies, became much more powerful.  The
function implementing a custom dependency is executed within a special
context where a number of extra variables and subroutines are
defined.  Publicly documented ones, intended to be long-term stable,
are listed below, under the heading "Variables and subroutines for
processing a rule". 

Examples of their use is given in the following examples, concerning
multiple index files and glossaries.

The only index-file conversion built-in to \fIlatexmk\fR is from an
".idx" file written on one run of \fI*latex\fR to an ".ind" file to
be read in on a subsequent run.  But with the index.sty package, for
example, you can create extra indexes with extensions that you
configure.  \fILatexmk\fR does not know how to deduce the extensions
from the information it has.  But you can easily write a custom
dependency.  For example if your latex file uses the command
"\\newindex{special}{ndx}{nnd}{Special index}" you will need to get
\fIlatexmk\fR to convert files with the extension \fI.ndx\fR to
\fI.nnd\fR.  The most elementary method is to define a custom
dependency as follows:

    add_cus_dep( 'ndx', 'nnd', 0, 'ndx2nnd' );
    sub ndx2nnd {
        return system( "makeindex -o \\"$_[0].nnd\\" \\"$_[0].ndx\\"" );
    }
    push @generated_exts, 'ndx', 'nnd';

Notice the added line compared with earlier examples.  The extra line
gets the extensions "ndx" and "nnd" added to the list of extensions
for generated files; then the extra index files will be deleted by
clean-up operations

But if you have yet more indexes with yet different extensions, e.g.,
"adx" and "and", then you will need a separate function for each pair
of extensions.  This is quite annoying.  You can use the
\fIRun_subst\fR function to simplify the definitions to use a single
function: 

    add_cus_dep( 'ndx', 'nnd', 0, 'dx2nd' );
    add_cus_dep( 'adx', 'and', 0, 'dx2nd' );
    sub dx2nd {
        return Run_subst( "makeindex -o %D %S" );
    }
    push @generated_exts, 'ndx', 'nnd', 'adx', 'and';

You could also instead use

    add_cus_dep( 'ndx', 'nnd', 0, 'dx2nd' );
    add_cus_dep( 'adx', 'and', 0, 'dx2nd' );
    sub dx2nd {
        return Run_subst( $makeindex );
    }
    push @generated_exts, 'ndx', 'nnd', 'adx', 'and';

This last example uses the command specification in \fI$makeindex\fR,
and so any customization you have made for the standard index also
applies to your extra indexes.

Similar techniques can be applied for glossaries.

Those of you with experience with Makefiles, may get
concerned that the \fI.ndx\fR file is written during a run of
\fI*latex\fR and is always later than the \fI.nnd\fR last read in.
Thus the \fI.nnd\fR appears to be perpetually out-of-date.  This
situation, of circular dependencies, is endemic to latex, and is one
of the issues that \fIlatexmk\fR is programmed to overcome.  It
examines the contents of the files (by use of a checksum), and only
does a remake when the file contents have actually changed.

Of course if you choose to write random data to the \fI.nnd\fR (or the
\fI.aux\fR file, etc) that changes on each new run, then you will have
a problem.  For real experts: See the \fI%hash_calc_ignore_pattern\fR
if you have to deal with such problems.

.SS Old Method of Defining Custom Dependencies:
In much older versions of \fIlatexmk\fR, the only method of defining
custom dependencies was to directly manipulate the table of custom
dependencies.  This is contained in the \fI@cus_dep_list\fR array.  It
is an array of strings, and each string in the array has four items in
it, each separated by a space, the from-extension, the to-extension,
the "must" item, and the name of the subroutine for the custom
dependency.  These were all defined above.
.PP
An example of the old method of defining custom dependencies is as
follows. It is the code in an RC file to ensure automatic conversion
of \fI.fig\fR files to \fI.eps\fR files:

    push @cus_dep_list, "fig eps 0 fig2eps";
    sub fig2eps {
        return system( "fig2dev -Lps \\"$_[0].fig\\" \\"$_[0].eps\\"" );
    }

This method still works, and is almost equivalent to the code given
earlier that used the \fIadd_cus_dep\fR subroutine.  However, the old
method doesn't delete any previous custom-dependency for the same
conversion.  So the new method is preferable.


.SH ADVANCED CONFIGURATION: SOME EXTRA RESOURCES AND ADVANCED TRICKS

For most purposes, simple configuration for \fIlatexmk\fR along the lines
of the examples given is sufficient.  But sometimes you need something
harder.  In this section, I indicate some extra possibilities.  Generally
to use these, you need to be fluent in the Perl language, since this is
what is used in the rc files.

In this section, I include first, a description of a number of variables
and subroutines that provide, among other things, access to latexmk's
internal data structures for handling dependencies.  Then I describe the
hook mechanism whereby at certain points in the processing, latexmk can
call user-defined subroutines.

See also the section DEALING WITH ERRORS, PROBLEMS, ETC.  See
also the examples in the directory \fIexample_rcfiles\fR in the
\fIlatexmk\fR distributions.  Even if none of the examples apply to
your case, they may give you useful ideas



.SS Variables and subroutines for processing a rule

A step in the processing is called a rule. One possibility to
implement the processing of a rule is by a Perl subroutine.  This is
always the case for custom dependencies. Also, for any other rule, you
can use a subroutine by prefixing the command specification by the
word "internal" -- see the section FORMAT OF COMMAND SPECIFICATIONS.

When you use a subroutine for processing a rule, all the possibilities
of Perl programming are available, of course.  In addition, some of
\fIlatexmk\fR's internal variables and subroutines are available.
The ones listed below are intended to be available to (advanced)
users, and their specifications will generally have stability under
upgrades. Generally, the variables should be treated as read-only:
Changing their values can have bad consequences, since it is liable to
mess up the consistency of what \fIlatexmk\fR is doing.
.TP
.B $rule
This variable has the name of the rule, as known to
\fIlatexmk\fR. Note that the exact contents of this variable for a
given rule may be dependent on the version of \fIlatexmk\fR
.TP
.B $$Pbase
This gives the basename for the rule.  Generally, it determines the names
of generated files.  E.g., for a run of *latex, the name of the .log file
is the aux directory concatenated with the basename and then `.log'.

For a *latex rule, the basename is without a directory component.  For
other rules, it includes the directory component (if any is used).

This (annoying) difference is associated with the different ways in which
the commands invoked by latexmk work when the command line includes a name
for a source file that includes a directory component.  For the *latex
commands, the directory of the source file is irrelevant to the directory
component the generated files, which instead is determined by the values in
the -aux-directory and/or -output-directory options.

In contrast, many other programs (e.g., biber, bibtex) put their generated
files in the same directory as the source file, merely with a changed extension.

Note the double dollar signs: In Perl terms, the variable \fI$Pbase\fR is a
\fIreference\fR to a variable that contains the basename.  The second
dollar sign derefences the reference to give the actual value.  (A
reference is is used rather like a pointer, and the `P' (for `pointer') at
the start of the variable name is a convention used in latexmk to indicate
that the variable is a reference variable.)

.TP
.B $$Pdest
This gives the name of the main output file if any.  Note the double
dollar signs.

.TP
.B $$Psource
This gives the name of the primary source file.  Note the double
dollar signs.

.TP
.B add_hook( <stack_name>, <subroutine> )
See the section `Hooks' for more details.

This adds the subroutine specified in the second argument to latexmk's
stack of hooks specified by the stack name.  It returns 1 on sucess, and
zero otherwise (e.g., if the specified hook stack doesn't exist).

The subroutine can be specified by a reference to the subroutine, as in

    add_hook( 'after_xlatex_analysis', \&mmz_analyze )

Given that the subroutine mmz_analyze has been defined in the rc file.

The subroutine can be specified by a string whose value is the name of the
subroutine, e.g., 

    add_hook( 'after_xlatex_analysis', 'mmz_analyze' )

In simple cases, the subroutine can be an anonymous subroutine defined in
the call to add_hooks, 

    add_hook( 'after_main_pdf', sub{ print "TEST\\n"; return 0; } );

Observe that on success, the subroutine should return 0 (like a call to
Perl's system subroutine), so normally this should be coded explicitly.  If
a hook subroutine returns a non-zero value, latexmk treats that as an error
condition. 


.TP
.B ensure_path( var, values ...)

The first parameter is the name of one of the system's environment
variables for search paths.  The remaining parameters are values that
should be in the variable.  For each of the value parameters, if it
isn't already in the variable, then it is prepended to the variable;
in that case the environment variable is created if it doesn't already
exist. For separating values, the character appropriate the the
operating system is used -- see the configuration variable
\fI$search_path_separator\fR. 

Example:

  ensure_path( 'TEXINPUTS', './custom_cls_sty_files//' );

(In this example, the trailing '//' is documented by TeX systems to
mean that \fI*latex\fR search for files in the specified
directory and in all subdirectories.)

Technically \fIensure_path\fR works by setting Perl's variable
\fI$ENV{var}\fR, where \fIvar\fR is the name of the target variable.
The changed value is then passed as an environment variable to any
invoked programs.

.TP
.B pushd( path ), popd()
These subroutines are used when it is needed to temporarily change the
working directory, as in

     pushd( 'some_directory' );
     ... Processing done with 'some_directory' as the working directory
     popd()

They perform exactly the same function as the commands of the same names in
operating system command shells like bash on Unix, and cmd.exe on the
Windows.

.TP
.B rdb_add_generated( file, ... )
This subroutine is to be used in the context of a rule, that is, from
within a subroutine that is carrying out processing of a rule.  Such is the
case for the subroutine implementing a custom dependency, or the subroutine
invoked by using the "internal" keyword in the command specification like
that in the variable \fI$latex\fR.

Its arguments are a sequence of filenames which are generated during the
running of the rule.  The names might arise from an analysis of the results
of the run, e.g., in a log file, or from knowledge of properties of the
specific rule.  Calling \fIrdb_add_generated\fR with these filenames
ensures that these files are flagged as generated by the rule in
\fIlatexmk\fR's internal data structures.  Basically, no action is taken if
the files have already been flagged as generated.

A main purpose of using this subroutine is for the situation when a
generated file is also the source file for some rule, so that \fIlatexmk\fR
can correctly link the dependency information in its network of rules.

\fINote: Unlike some other subroutines in this section, there is no
argument for a rule for \fRrdb_add_generated\fI. Instead, the subroutine is
to be invoked during the processing of a rule when \fRlatexmk\fI has set up
an appropriate context (i.e., appropriate variables).  In contrast,
subroutines with a rule argument can be used also outside a rule context.\fR

.TP
.B rdb_ensure_file( $rule, file )
This subroutine ensures that the given file is among the source
files for the specified rule.  It is typically used when, during the
processing of a rule, it is known that a particular extra file is
among the dependencies that \fIlatexmk\fR should know, but its default
methods don't find the dependency. Almost always the first argument is
the name of the rule currently being processed, so it is then
appropriate to specify it by \fI$rule\fR.

For examples of its use, see some of the files in the directory
\fIexample_rcfiles\fR of \fIlatexmk\fR's distribution.  Currently the
cases that use this subroutine are \fIbib2gls-latexmkrc\fR,
\fIexceltex_latexmkrc\fR and \fItexinfo-latexmkrc\fR.  These
illustrate typical cases where \fIlatexmk\fR's normal processing fails
to detect certain extra source files.

\fINote that \fRrdb_ensure_file\fI only has one filename argument, unlike
other subroutines in this section.  If you want to apply its action to
multiple files, you will need one call to \fRrdb_ensure_file\fI for each
file.\fR

.TP
.B rdb_ensure_files_here( file, ... )
Like subroutine \fIrdb_ensure_files\fR, except that (a) it assumes the
context is of a rule, and the files are to be added to the source list for
that rule; (b) multiple files are allowed.

.TP
.B rdb_remove_files( $rule, file, ... )
This subroutine removes one or more files from the dependency list for
the given rule. 

.TP
.B rdb_remove_generated( file, ... )
This subroutine is to be used in the context of a rule, that is, from
within a subroutine that is carrying out processing of a rule.  It performs
the opposite action to \fIrdb_add_generated\fR.  Its effect is to ensure
that the given filenames are not listed in \fIlatexmk\fR's internal data
structures as being generated by the rule.

.TP
.B rdb_list_source( $rule )
This subroutine returns the list of source files (i.e., the dependency
list) for the given rule. 

.TP
.B rdb_set_source( $rule, file, ... )

.TP
.B rdb_set_source( $rule, @files )
This subroutine sets the dependency list for the given rule to be the
specified files.  Files that are already in the list have unchanged
information.  Files that were not in the list are added to it.  Files
in the previous dependency list that are not in the newly specified
list of files are removed from the dependency list.

.TP
.B Run_subst( command_spec )
This subroutine runs the command specified by \fIcommand_spec\fR.  The
specification is a string in the format listed in the section "Format
of Command Specifications".  An important action of the
\fIRun_subst\fR is to make substitutions of placeholders, e.g., %S and
%D for source and destination files; these get substituted before the
command is run.  In addition, the command after substitution is
printed to the screen unless \fIlatexmk\fR is running in silent mode.

.TP
.B test_gen_file_time ( <file> )
This subroutine is used in the context of a rule.  It returns true or
false according to whether or not a file of the given name both exists
and was generated in the latest run of the rule.  If the subroutine returns
false, but the file exists, then the file is a leftover from a previous
run.

The test for a file being generated on the current run is whether the
modification time of the file is at least as recent as the time that the
run of the rule was started.  An allowance for the granularity of the
values of modification time on file systems is made.  See the description
of the variable \fB$filetime_causality_threshold\fR for details.

In addition, latexmk makes allowance for the possiblity that files are
hosted on a different computer than that running latexmk and that the
system clock times on the two computers are mismatched.  Latexmk
automatically detects (and reports) any significant mismatch and corrects
for it.

.SS Coordinated Setting of Commands for *latex

To set all of \fI$dvilualatex\fR, \fI$hilatex\fR, \fI$latex\fR,
\fI$pdflatex\fR, \fI$lualatex\fR, and \fI$xelatex\fR to a common pattern,
you can use one of the following subroutines, std_tex_cmds, alt_tex_cmds,
and set_tex_cmds.

To get the standard commands, use

   &std_tex_cmds;

This results in \fI$latex = 'latex %O %S'\fR, and similarly for
\fI$dvilualatex\fR, \fI$hilatex\fR, \fI$pdflatex\fR, \fI$lualatex\fR, and
\fI$xelatex\fR.  Note the ampersand in the invocation; this indicates to
Perl that a subroutine is being called.  (The use of this subroutine
enables you to override previous redefinitions of the \fI$latex\fR, etc
variables, which might have occurred in an earlier-read rc file.)

To be able to use the string provided by the -pretex option (if any), you
can use

   &alt_tex_cmds;

This results in \fI$latex = 'latex %O %P'\fR, etc.  Again note the
ampersand in the invocation; this indicates to Perl that a subroutine is
being called.

A more general way of specifying the variables is using

  set_tex_cmds( 'CMD_SPEC' );

Here CMD_SPEC is the command line without the program name. This
results in \fI$latex = 'latex CMD_SPEC'\fR, and similarly for
\fI$pdflatex\fR, etc.  (An ampersand preceding the subroutine name is not
necessary here, since the parentheses show Perl that a subroutine is being
invoked.) 

An example that provides the \fI--interaction=batchmode\fR option to the
*latex commands would be

  set_tex_cmds( '--interaction=batchmode %O %S' );

This results in \fI$latex = 'latex --interaction=batchmode %O %S '\fR, etc.
Note that when '%O' appears after the added option, as here, options
provided on the command line to \fIlatexmk\fR can override the supplied
one.

A more general command line can be set up by using the placeholder '%C' in
CMD_SPEC.  The '%C' is substituted by the basic name of the command, i.e.,
whichever of 'latex', 'pdflatex', etc is appropriate.  (More than one
occurrence of '%C' is allowed.)  For example to use the
development/pre-release versions of latex, etc, which have
names, 'latex-dev', 'pdflatex-dev', etc, you could use

  set_tex_cmds( '%C-dev %O %S' );

This results in \fI$latex = 'latex-dev %O %S'\fR, etc.  (The pre-release
programs latex-dev etc are provided in current distributions of TeXLive and
MiKTeX.)

.SS Hooks

Latexmk provides a way to arrange for user-defined subroutines to be called
at certain points in the processing.  These can be used to configure
appropriate behavior and actions beyond latexmk's normal behavior.  For a
good example of how they can be used to accommodate latexmk's behavior to
particular packages, see the file memoize_latexmkrc in the example_rcfiles
subdirectory of the latexmk distribution.  (In a standard TeXLive
installation, that subdirectory is to be found in
texmf-dist/doc/support/latexmk/)

The hook mechanism is complementary to the method of redefining command
strings like \fB$pdflatex\fR etc.  The two methods have overlapping domains
of usefulness.

Note that the hook mechanism is newly made public in v. 4.84 of latexmk.
It is subject to change and improvement as experience is gained.

The hooks are arranged in named hook stacks, and a hook subroutine is added
to a given stack by latexmk's add_hook subroutine (documented above).  The
currently available stacks are as follows, listed in the approximate order
in which they are encountered in processing a document:

.TP 2
  before_xlatex
  The subroutines in this hook stack are called just before a
  *latex programs is run.  

.TP 2
  after_xlatex
  The subroutines in this hook stack are called after a *latex programs is
  run.  Before the subroutines are called, latexmk has done some immediate
  postprocessing, e.g., to move the generated pdf file from the aux
  directory to the output directory when \fB$emulate_aux\fR is set to 1.

.TP 2
  after_xlatex_analysis
  The subroutines in this hook stack are called after latexmk has done its
  dependency analysis after a *latex programs is run.  Subroutines in this
  stack provide a useful way of adding items to the dependency information
  associated with particular packages and that latexmk doesn't
  automatically deal with.

.TP 2
  after_main_pdf
  The subroutines in this hook stack are called after one of the rules that
  creates the document's pdf file. (This covers any of pdflatex, lualatex,
  dvipdf, ps2pdf, xdvipdfmx.)

.TP 2
  cleanup
  The subroutines in this hook stack are called whenever latexmk is about
  to do a cleanup operation.  They can be used, for example, to tailor the
  deleted files to the pecularities of particular packages when latexmk's
  general mechanisms for specifying files to be deleted are too inflexible. 

  These subroutines are called before latexmk does any of its own file
  deletion; thus the hook subroutines have access to all the generated
  files that give package-specific information.

.TP 2
  cleanup_extra_full
  The subroutines in this hook stack are called in addition to the ones in
  the cleanup stack, whenever a full cleanup operation is to be done (i.e.,
  one that includes the pdf, ps etc files).  They are called immediately
  after those in the cleanup stack, but still before latexmk does any of
  its own file deletion.

.PP

(Any other stacks defined in latexmk.pl but not listed above are to be
regarded as experimental and subject to change.)

Each subroutine should return 0 on success and a non-zero value on failure.
This matches the convention used for running programs, e.g., by Perl's
system subroutine, and the matching convention used for subroutines for
custom dependencies in latexmk. 

For most of the hook stacks, the subroutines are called in the context of a
rule, with variables like \fB$rule\fR defined.  However, some hook stacks,
like the cleanup ones, are called from outside any rule; and latexmk
adjusts the relevant variables to refer to the overall task (i.e., of
processing a particular main .tex file).

.SS Advanced configuration: Using \fIlatexmk\fB with \fImake\fR

This section is targeted only at advanced users who use the \fImake\fR
program for complex projects, as for software development, with the
dependencies specified by a Makefile.

Now the basic task of \fIlatexmk\fR is to run the appropriate programs
to make a viewable version of a LaTeX document.  However, the usual
\fImake\fR program is not suited to this purpose for at least two
reasons.  First is that the use of LaTeX involves circular
dependencies (e.g., via .aux files), and these cannot be handled by
the standard \fImake\fR program.  Second is that in a large document
the set of source files can change quite frequently, particularly with
included graphics files; in this situation keeping a Makefile manually
updated is inappropriate and error-prone, especially when the
dependencies can be determined automatically.  \fILatexmk\fR solves
both of these problems robustly.

Thus for many standard LaTeX documents \fIlatexmk\fR can be used by
itself without the \fImake\fR program.  In a complex project it simply
needs to be suitably configured.  A standard configuration would be to
define custom dependencies to make graphics files from their source
files (e.g., as created by the \fIxfig\fR program).  Custom
dependencies are \fIlatexmk\fR's equivalent of pattern rules in
Makefiles.

Nevertheless there are projects for which a Makefile is appropriate,
and it is useful to know how to use \fIlatexmk\fR from a Makefile.  A
typical example would be to generate documentation for a software
project.  Potentially the interaction with the rest of the rules in
the Makefile could be quite complicated, for example if some of the
source files for a LaTeX document are generated by the project's
software.

In this section, I give a couple of examples of how \fIlatexmk\fR can
be usefully invoked from a Makefile.  The examples use specific
features of current versions of GNU \fImake\fR, which is the default
on both linux and OS-X systems.  They may need modifications for other
versions of \fImake\fR.  

The simplest method is simply to delegate all the relevant tasks to
\fIlatexmk\fR, as is suitable for a straightforward LaTeX document.
For this a suitable Makefile is like

    .PHONY : FORCE_MAKE
    all : try.pdf
    %.pdf : %.tex FORCE_MAKE
        latexmk -pdf -dvi- -ps- $< 

(Note: the last line must be introduced by a tab for the Makefile to
function correctly!)  Naturally, if making try.pdf from its associated
LaTeX file try.tex were the only task to be performed, a direct use of
\fIlatexmk\fR without a Makefile would normally be better.  The
benefit of using a Makefile for a LaTeX document would be in a larger
project, where lines such as the above would be only be a small part
of a larger Makefile.

The above example has a pattern rule for making a .pdf file from 
a .tex file, and it is defined to use \fIlatexmk\fR in the obvious way.
There is a conventional default target named "all", with a
prerequisite of try.pdf.  So when \fImake\fR is invoked, by default it
makes try.pdf.  The only complication is that there may be many source
files beyond try.tex, but these aren't specified in the Makefile, so
changes in them will not by themselves cause \fIlatexmk\fR to be
invoked.  Instead, the pattern rule is equipped with a "phony"
prerequisite FORCE_MAKE; this has the effect of causing the rule to be
always out-of-date, so that \fIlatexmk\fR is always run.  It is
\fIlatexmk\fR that decides whether any action is needed, e.g., a rerun
of \fIpdflatex\fR.  Effectively the Makefile delegates all decisions
to \fIlatexmk\fR, while \fImake\fR has no knowledge of the list of
source files except for primary LaTeX file for the  document.  If
there are, for example, graphics files to be made, these must be
made by custom dependencies configured in \fIlatexmk\fR.

But something better is needed in more complicated situations, for
example, when the making of graphics files needs to be specified by
rules in the Makefile.  To do this, one can use a Makefile like the
following: 

     TARGETS = document1.pdf document2.pdf
     DEPS_DIR = .deps
     LATEXMK = latexmk -recorder -use-make -deps \\
           -e 'warn qq(In Makefile, turn off custom dependencies\\n);' \\
           -e '@cus_dep_list = ();' \\
           -e 'show_cus_dep();'
     all : $(TARGETS)
     $(foreach file,$(TARGETS),$(eval -include $(DEPS_DIR)/$(file)P))
     $(DEPS_DIR) :
            mkdir $@
     %.pdf : %.tex
            if [ ! -e $(DEPS_DIR) ]; then mkdir $(DEPS_DIR); fi
            $(LATEXMK) -pdf -dvi- -ps- -deps-out=$(DEPS_DIR)/$@P $< 
     %.pdf : %.fig
            fig2dev -Lpdf $< $@

(Again, the lines containing the commands for the rules should be
started with tabs.)  This example was inspired by how GNU
\fIautomake\fR handles automatic dependency tracking of C source
files.

After each run of \fIlatexmk\fR, dependency information is put in a file
in the .deps subdirectory.  The Makefile causes these dependency files
to be read by \fImake\fR, which now has the full dependency
information for each target .pdf file.  To make things less trivial it
is specificed that two files document1.pdf and document2.pdf are the
targets.  The dependency files are .deps/document1.pdfP 
and .deps/document2.pdfP.

There is now no need for the phony prerequisite for the rule to 
make .pdf files from .tex files.  But I have added a rule to 
make .pdf files from .fig files produced by the \fIxfig\fR program;
these are commonly used for graphics insertions in LaTeX documents.
\fILatexmk\fR is arranged to output a dependency file after each run.
It is given the \fB-recorder\fR option, which improves its detection
of files generated during a run of \fIpdflatex\fR; such files should
not be in the dependency list.  The \fB-e\fR options are used to turn
off all custom dependencies, and to document this.  Instead the
\fB-use-make\fR is used to delegate the making of missing files to
\fImake\fR itself.

Suppose in the LaTeX file there is a command \\includegraphics{graph},
and an \fIxfig\fR file "graph.fig" exists.  On a first run,
\fIpdflatex\fR reports a missing file, named "graph". \fILatexmk\fR
succeeds in making "graph.pdf" by calling "make graph.pdf", and after
completion of its work, it lists "fig.pdf" among the dependents of the
file \fIlatexmk\fR is making.  Then let "fig.fig" be updated, and then
let \fImake\fR be run.  \fIMake\fR first remakes "fig.pdf", and only
then reruns \fIlatexmk\fR.

Thus we now have a method by which all the subsidiary processing is
delegated to \fImake\fR.

\fBEscaping of characters in dependency lists\fR: There are certain special
characters that need to be escaped when names of files and directories
containing them appear in a dependency list used by a make program.
Generally, such special characters are best avoided.

By default, latexmk does no escaping of this kind, and the user will have
to arrange to deal with the issue separately, if the relevant special
characters are used.  Note that the rules for escaping depend on which make
program is used, and on its version.

One special case is of spaces, since those are particularly prevalent,
notably in standard choices of name for a user's home directory.  So
latexmk does provide an option to escape spaces.  See the option
\fB-deps_escape=...\fR and the variable \fB$deps_escape\fR for details.


.SH NON_ASCII CHARACTERS IN FILENAMES, RC FILES, ETC

Modern operating systems and file systems allow non-ASCII characters in
the names of files and directories that encompass the full Unicode range.
Mostly, \fIlatexmk\fR deals with these correctly.  However, there are some
situations in which there are problems, notably on Microsoft Windows.
Prior to version 4.77, \fIlatexmk\fR had problems with non-ASCII filenames
on Windows, even though there were no corresponding problems on macOS and
Linux.  These problems are corrected in the present version.

.SH BUGS (SELECTED)
Sometimes a viewer (gv) tries to read an updated .ps or .pdf file
after its creation is started but before the file is complete.  Work
around: manually refresh (or reopen) display.  Or use one of the other
previewers and update methods.  

(The following isn't really a bug, but concerns features of previewers.)
Preview continuous mode only works perfectly with certain previewers:
Xdvi on UNIX/Linux works for dvi files.  
Gv on UNIX/Linux works for both postscript and pdf.
Ghostview on UNIX/Linux needs a manual update (reopen); it views
postscript and pdf. 
Gsview under MS-Windows works for both postscript and pdf, 
but only reads the updated file when its screen is refreshed.
Acroread under UNIX/Linux views pdf, but the file needs to be closed
and reopened to view an updated version.
Under MS-Windows, acroread locks its input file and so the
pdf file cannot be updated.  (Remedy: configure \fIlatexmk\fR to use
\fIsumatrapdf\fR instead.)
