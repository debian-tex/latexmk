Title: README / Documents for latexmk
Author: John Collins
Abstract: Latexmk completely automates the process of generating a LaTeX
 document.  Essentially, it is a highly specialized cousin of the
 general make utility.  Given the source files for a document, latexmk
 issues the appropriate sequence of commands to generate a .dvi, .ps,
 .pdf or hardcopy version of the document, including repeated running
 of the programs until cross references etc are resolved.  Latexmk can also
 be set to run continuously with a previewer; the LaTeX program, etc,
 are rerun whenever one of the source files is modified.
