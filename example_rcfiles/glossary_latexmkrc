# In many earlier versions of latexmk, there was a file glossary_latexmrc that
# originally showed how to use the glossary package with latexmk.  That
# package is now OBSOLETE, and one should use the glossaries package or the
# glossaries-extra package.

# The code for using the glossaries package with latexmk is in the file
# glossaries_latexmkrc.  It also contains (commented out) code for the use
# of the glossary package, and has some comments on the issues involved.
