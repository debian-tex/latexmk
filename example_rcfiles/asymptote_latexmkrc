# This shows how to use Asymptote (http://asymptote.sourceforge.net/,
# or http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/graphics/asymptote/)
# with latexmk.  Asymptote is a vector graphics language with a
# processing program that generates graphics files that can be used in
# a LaTex file.  
#
# A standard method of using it is with the asymptote LaTeX style file
# (http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/graphics/asymptote/doc/asymptote.sty)
# The graphics drawing code is in the tex file, and applying pdflatex to
# the tex file produces one or more files with a base name the same as
# or related to the main tex file, but with the extension 'asy'.  The
# .asy is processed by the program asy (part of the asymptote
# software) to produce graphics files (which may be eps, tex, or pdf
# files) that are used the next time pdflatex is run on the main tex
# file.    
#
# Latexmk can be arranged to run asymptote (i.e., the program asy)
# when needed, by defining the following custom dependency.  (The code
# is to be put in one of latexmk's rc files, e.g., ~/.latexmkrc.)
#

# The following lines are taken from the documentation for V. 2.03 of
# asymptote:
sub asy {return system("asy \"$_[0]\"");}
add_cus_dep("asy","eps",0,"asy");
add_cus_dep("asy","pdf",0,"asy");
add_cus_dep("asy","tex",0,"asy");
